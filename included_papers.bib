Abstract = {{The Cypher Physical Power Systems (CPPS) became vital targets for
   intruders because of the large volume of high speed heterogeneous data
   provided from the Wide Area Measurement Systems (WAMS). The Nonnested
   Generalized Exemplars (NNGE) algorithm is one of the most accurate
   classification techniques that can work with such data of CPPS. However,
   NNGE algorithm tends to produce rules that test a large number of input
   features. This poses some problems for the large volume data and hinders
   the scalability of any detection system. In this paper, we introduce
   VHDRA, a Vertical and Horizontal Data Reduction Approach, to improve the
   classification accuracy and speed of the NNGE algorithm and reduce the
   computational resource consumption. VHDRA provides the following
   functionalities: (1) it vertically reduces the dataset features by
   selecting the most significant features and by reducing the NNGE's
   hyperrectangles. (2) It horizontally reduces the size of data while
   preserving original key events and patterns within the datasets using an
   approach called STEM, State Tracking and Extraction Method. The
   experiments show that the overall performance of VHDRA using both the
   vertical and the horizontal reduction reduces the NNGE hyperrectangles
   by 29.06\%, 37.34\%, and 26.76\% and improves the accuracy of the NNGE
   by 8.57\%, 4.19\%, and 3.78\% using the Multi-, Binary, and Triple class
   datasets, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are playing important roles in the critical
   infrastructure now. A prominent family of CPSs are networked control
   systems in which the control and feedback signals are carried over
   computer networks like the Internet. Communication over insecure
   networks make system vulnerable to cyber attacks. In this article, we
   design an intrusion detection and compensation framework based on
   system/plant identification to fight covert attacks. We collect error
   statistics of the output estimation during the learning phase of system
   operation and after that, monitor the system behavior to see if it
   significantly deviates from the expected outputs. A compensating
   controller is further designed to intervene and replace the classic
   controller once the attack is detected. The proposed model is tested on
   a DC motor as the plant and is put against a deception signal
   amplification attack over the forward link. Simulation results show that
   the detection algorithm well detects the intrusion and the compensator
   is also successful in alleviating the attack effects.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber physical systems (CPS) are used to control chemical processes, and
   can be found in manufacturing, civil infrastructure, energy industry,
   transportation and in many more places. There is one common
   characteristic in these areas, their operation is critical as a
   malfunction can potential be life-threatening. In the past, an attack
   against the cyber part of the systems can lead to physical consequences.
   The first well known attack against a CPS was Stuxnet in 2010. It is
   challenging to develop countermeasures in this field without endangering
   the normal operation of the underlying system. In our research, our goal
   was to detect attacks without interfering with the cyber physical
   systems in any way. This can be realized by an anomaly detection system
   using passive network monitoring. Our approach is based on analysing the
   state of the physical process by interpreting the communication between
   the control system and the supervisory system. This state can be
   compared to a model based prediction of the system, which can serve as a
   solid base for intrusion detection. In order to realize our intrusion
   detection system, a testbed was built based on widely used Siemens PLCs.
   Our implementation consists of three main parts. The first task is to
   understand the network communication in order to gain information about
   the controlled process. This was realized by analysing and deeply
   understanding the publicly undocumented Siemens management protocol. The
   resulting protocol parser was integrated into the widely-used Bro
   network security monitoring framework. Gathering information about the
   process state for a prolonged time creates time series. With these time
   series, as the second step, statistical models of the physical process
   can be built to predict future states. As the final step, the new states
   of the physical process can be compared with the predicted states.
   Significant differences can be considered as an indicator of compromise.}},

Abstract = {{Attacks to Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) are detected by Industrial
   Intrusion Detection Systems (IIDSs). Operation of stage-based CPSs
   (those for which their underlying process is batch) consists of three
   parts: normal states, normal transitions between the normal states, and
   normal time-intervals for transitions. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art
   IIDSs directly ad-dress cyber-attacks that result in anomalous states
   whereas anomalous transitions or time-intervals can also indicate
   cyber-attacks. In this paper, a State-based IDS (SIDS) is proposed to
   detect all three anomalies. For doing this, SIDS first automatically
   extracts the normal behavior of CPS. Then it monitors current CPS
   behavior and detects intrusions by directly looking at the data of field
   layer. A small-scale but real CPS (a mixer process) is provided to
   illustrate how SIDS works. In addition, experimental results on three
   cyber-attacks orchestrated on a simulated milk pasteurization process
   indicate that SIDS can successfully detect cyber-attacks to large I/O
   CPSs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Without robust security mechanisms, the smart grid remains vulnerable to

   with a focus on two smart grid security issues: (i) Firstly, against
   integrity issue with price manipulation attack, we propose a Cumulative
   Sum (CUSUM) algorithm that detects this attack even with granular price
   changes; (ii) Secondly, the availability issue with Denial of Service
   (DoS) attack against which we develop an efficient method to monitor and
   detect any misbehaving node. Performance evaluations show the robustness
   of the proposed IDS system compared to existing mechanisms. The achieved
   detection rate is above 95\% and the false positive rate is below 5\%.}},

Abstract = {{The fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0, brings
   many advantages including innovative applications and services, new
   technologies and advanced features, increased operational benefits, and
   reduced installation costs. However, this technological advancement also
   exposes several challenges pertaining to the development of
   cyber-physical industrial architectures, resilient communication
   systems, and secure data exchange. This paper develops a systematic
   methodology for designing intrusion detection systems (IDS) specially
   tailored to address the cyber and physical dimensions of these systems.
   The approach is aimed at reducing the number of monitored parameters by
   adopting a three-phase design strategy embracing sensitivity analysis,
   cross-association, and optimal IDS design. To this end, phase 1 embraces
   sensitivity analysis to identify sensitive variables to specific
   interventions (e.g., control signals and cyber attacks), phase 2 adopts
   the cross-association assessment to optimally structure the process
   variables in groups that are the most sensitive to groups of
   interventions, and finally, phase 3 optimally assigns the most sensitive
   process variables to IDS, while enforcing the IDS capacity limitations
   and redundancy requirements. Numerical results on a realistic vinyl
   acetate monomer process show that the approach can reduce the number of
   variables by 76.8\%, thus reducing the complexity and the costs of the
   detection infrastructure.}},

   industrial scenarios. Therefore, there is a need to develop new
   techniques or modify the current security mechanisms to overcome these
   problems. In this article, we focus on Intrusion Detection (ID)
   techniques and propose a new attack-defense game model to detect
   malicious nodes using a repeated game approach. As a direct consequence
   of the game model, attackers and defenders make different strategies to
   achieve optimal payoffs. Importantly, error detection and missing
   detection are taken into consideration in Intrusion Detection Systems
   (IDSs), where a game tree model is introduced to solve this problem. In
   addition, we analyze and prove the existence of pure Nash equilibrium
   and mixed Nash equilibrium. Simulations show that the proposed model can
   both reduce energy consumption by up to 50\% compared with the existing
   All Monitor (AM) model and improve the detection rate by up to 10\% to
   15\% compared with the existing Cluster Head (CH) monitor model.}},

Abstract = {{Intrusion detection is a major concern in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs).
   In this paper, an algorithm based on Petri Net (PN) is proposed that
   simultaneously detects misuse and anomaly behavior of the system. The
   proposed anomaly detection method is applicable to Supervisory Control
   and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system at the highest level of CPSs. Neural
   First Order Hybrid Petri Net model (NFOHPN) with online fast Independent
   Component Analysis (ICA) is proposed for anomaly detection. It is shown
   that the use of distributed and multidisciplinary intrusion detection
   methods in different layers of CPSs increases security of the net
   against coordinated cyber-attacks. Simulation results and comparative
   studies based on the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
   evaluation datasets demonstrate that the proposed model can detect
   normal or malicious behavior with satisfying accuracy and at
   surprisingly high convergence speed.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, the industrial control system (ICS) plays a vital role in
   critical infrastructures like the power grid. However, there is an
   increasing security concern that ICS devices are being vulnerable to
   malicious users/attackers, where any subtle changing or tampering attack
   would cause significant damage to industrial manufacturing. In this
   paper, we propose the iFinger, a novel detection approach designed to
   mitigate ICS attacks adapting to various industrial scenes. We take
   advantage of an important insight that industrial protocol packets
   include register status values that are used to reflect the physical
   characteristics of ICS controllers. The iFinger utilizes register states
   to generate ICS fingerprints to detect malicious attacks on industrial
   networks. Specifically, the boolean logic represents every register
   state sequence of the ICS controller, and the deterministic finite
   automaton (DFA) generates a device fingerprint. To discover the ICS
   attacks, we propose two detection approaches based on device
   fingerprints, including passive and active detection. We present a
   prototype of the iFinger and conduct real-world experiments to validate
   its performance. Results show that our approach achieves 97.1\% F1 score
   in ICS device identification. Furthermore, we simulate two typical ICS
   attacks (replacement and code modification) to validate the
   effectiveness of our iFinger in industrial networks. Our device
   fingerprints would detect those malicious attacks within 2s latency at
   98.0\% recall.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial control systems (ICS) are becoming more integral to modern
   life as they are being integrated into critical infrastructure. These
   systems typically lack application layer encryption and the placement of
   common network intrusion services have large blind spots. We propose the
   novel architecture, Cloud Based Intrusion Detection and Prevention
   System (CB-IDPS), to detect and prevent threats in ICS networks by using
   software defined networking (SDN) to route traffic to the cloud for
   inspection using network function virtualization (NFV) and service
   function chaining. CB-IDPS uses Amazon Web Services to create a virtual
   private cloud for packet inspection. The CB-IDPS framework is designed
   with considerations to the ICS delay constraints, dynamic traffic
   routing, scalability, resilience, and visibility. CB-IDPS is presented
   in the context of a micro grid energy management system as the test case
   to prove that the latency of CB-IDPS is within acceptable delay
   thresholds. The implementation of CB-IDPS uses the OpenDaylight software
   for the SDN controller and commonly used network security tools such as
   Zeek and Snort. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at using NFV
   in an ICS context for network security.}},

Abstract = {{Modern indusfrial control systems (ICS) are increasingly becoming
   targets of cyber attacks. Traditional security tools based on a
   signature approach are not always able to detect a new attack, the
   signature of which has not yet been described. In particular, this
   occurs during targeted attacks on indusfrial facilities. Cyber attacks
   can cause anomalies in the operation of an industrial control system and
   process equipment under its control. Therefore, to detect attacks, it is
   advisable to use an approach based on the detection of anomalies. A
   reasonable way to implement this approach is to use machine learning
   techniques. The paper deals with the most common methods of machine
   learning (decision free algorithms, linear algorithms, support vector
   machine) and neural networks. To assess their applicability in the

   Based on Ethernet/IP}},
Journal = {{ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Standard Ethernet (IEEE 802.3 and the TCP/IP protocol suite) is
   gradually applied in industrial control system (ICS) with the
   development of information technology. It breaks the natural isolation
   of ICS, but contains no security mechanisms. An improved intrusion
   detection system (IDS), which is strongly correlated to specific
   industrial scenarios, is necessary for modern ICS. On one hand, this
   paper outlines three kinds of attack models, including infiltration
   attacks, creative forging attacks, and false data injection attacks. On
   the other hand, a two stage IDS is proposed, which contains a traffic
   prediction model and an anomaly detection model. The traffic prediction
   model, which is based on the autoregressive integrated moving average
   (ARIMA), can forecast the traffic of the ICS network in the short term
   and detect infiltration attacks precisely according to the abnormal
   changes in traffic patterns. Furthermore, the anomaly detection model,
   using a one class support vector machine (OCSVM), is able to detect
   malicious control instructions by analyzing the key field in Ethernet/IP
   packets. The confusion matrix is selected to testify to the
   effectiveness of the proposed method, and two other innovative IDSs are
   used for comparison. The experiment results show that the proposed two
   stage IDS in this paper has an outstanding performance in detecting
   infiltration attacks, forging attacks, and false data injection attacks
   compared with other IDSs.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the complexity of industrial control systems and the diversity of
   protocols in networks, it is difficult to build intrusion detection
   models based on network characteristics and physical modeling. In order
   to build a better flow model without additional knowledge, we propose an
   intrusion detection method based on the content of network packets. The
   construction of the model is based on the idea of ZOE method. The
   similarity between flows is calculated through the sequential coverage
   algorithm, the normal flow model is established by multi-layered
   clustering algorithm, and the Count-Mean-Min Sketch is used to store and
   count the flow model. By comparing the unknown flow with the constructed
   normal flow model, we achieve the intrusion detection of industrial
   control system (ICS). The overall experimental results on 4 ICS datasets
   show that the improved method can effectively improve the detection rate
   and reduce the false-positive rate. The detection rate reached 96.7\% on
   average, and the false-positive rate reached 0.7\% on average.}},

Abstract = {{The security of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) is closely related to
   national security. With secret exploration and analysis of a target ICS,
   highly-skilled attackers can gain enough key knowledge about the system
   (e.g., the physical model of the system and the corresponding detection
   threshold), and then launch stealthy attacks by keeping the detection
   indicator under its threshold, thus bypasses existing intrusion
   detection mechanisms. However, we discover that all devices in
   industrial control systems consume energy at run time and the energy
   consumption varies according to different operation types and system
   states. Therefore, there exists relationships between control operation,
   system state and energy consumption of the device. Accordingly, we put
   forward a novel ICS intrusion detection approach based on
   multi-dimensional data fusion. This approach collects information about
   power consumption of physical devices, control operation and system
   state, and then identifies stealthy attacks by feeding the
   multi-dimensional information into a cascade detection algorithm.
   Experimental results verify that our approach has a better detection
   performance than other detection methods.}},

Abstract = {{It is difficult to prevent attackers from intruding into the industrial
   control system(ICS) physically, who can connect external devices to the
   system to steal information or inject false data. In this paper, a
   physical intrusion detection method is proposed for ICS, by analyzing
   the communication signal at physical layer. RS485, one of the most
   important and widely-used serial bus, is selected to investigate how the
   intruded devices influence the voltage signal in ICS network. The model
   of voltage signal in RS485 communication lines is built to represent the
   difference caused by the variation of devices and detect the intruded
   devices. In the simulation, we demonstrate how to detect an intruded
   device in a two-device RS485 system.}},

Abstract = {{As closed Industrial Control Systems (ICS) gradually evolve toward
   networking, ICS data and operational processes can be easily tampered
   with by attackers, causing industrial control equipment to fail or
   become damaged. Depending on the characteristics of ICS business logic
   stability, this paper proposes a novel two-level anomaly detection
   framework to ensure that system data and business logic are safe and
   reliable. Specifically, basic information is obtained from network
   traffic. In our framework, the first-level detection uses convolutional
   neural network (CNN) to feature extraction and anomaly identification.
   In the second-level detection, we propose a process state transfer
   algorithm. The feature extracted by the CNN model is invoked as the
   input of the algorithm to construct the normal state process transfer
   model of ICS. The model detects whether the current data meets the
   normal state transition process of the system, and may find unknown
   attacks or 0-day attacks. Finally, through laboratory gas pipeline
   network system verification, we found that the anomaly detection
   framework combined with the two methods has more outstanding performance
   than several current latest technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Intrusion detection is a prevailing area of research for several years,
   and numerous intrusion detection systems have been proposed for
   industrial control systems (ICS). In recent ages, the attacks like
   seismic net, duqu and flame against ICS infrastructures have instigated
   great harm to nuclear infrastructures and precarious facilities in
   several nations. The authors outline an approach to detect
   intrusions/anomalies in K'S. A method is presented to detect intrusions
   in real-time and automatically. The existing techniques are normally
   designed for open systems and protocols, that lacks adequate
   generalisation and resistance to acclimate to other networks, and they
   have either short detection rote or tall rate of false positive. This
   Letter presents a network packet contents behaviour and bidirectional
   Gated Recurrent Units-based method to detect intrusions in a timely and
   efficient manner. The method has proven a robust method of classifying
   intmsions/anomalies in a proficient way. Through extensive evaluation on
   an actual huge scale dataset spawned from SCADA-based gas pipeline
   network, the proposed method shows significant performance enhancement
   and outclasses the standard state-of-the-art methods with 98.68\% rate
   of accuracy. Moreover, it is also able to detect zero-day (unseen)
   attacks.}},

   However, due to the particularity of the industrial control system, the

   optimizes the particle swarm algorithm with nonlinear reduction inertia

Abstract = {{An increasing number of wireless intelligent equipment is applied to ICS
   networks. However, it is virtually impossible to use regular encryption
   methods and security patches to enhance the security level of legacy
   equipment in ICS networks due to weak computing and storage capabilities
   of the equipment. To address these concerns, a hybrid-augmented device
   fingerprinting approach is developed to enhance traditional intrusion
   detection mechanisms in the ICS network. Taking the advantage of the
   simplicity of the program process and stability of hardware
   configurations, we first measure inter-layer data response processing
   time, and then analyze network traffic to filter abnormal packets to
   achieve the intrusion classification and detection in ICS networks. The
   device finger-printing-based intrusion classification and detection
   approach is evaluated using the data collected from a lab-level
   micro-grid, and forgery attacks and intrusions are launched against the
   proposed method to investigate its robustness and effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Modbus over TCP/IP is one of the most popular industrial network
   protocol that are widely used in critical infrastructures. However,
   vulnerability of Modbus TCP protocol has attracted widely concern in the
   public. The traditional intrusion detection methods can identify some
   intrusion behaviors, but there are still some problems. In this paper,
   we present an innovative approach, SD-IDS (Stereo Depth IDS), which is
   designed for perform real-time deep inspection for Modbus TCP traffic.
   SD-IDS algorithm is composed of two parts: rule extraction and deep
   inspection. The rule extraction module not only analyzes the
   characteristics of industrial traffic, but also explores the semantic
   relationship among the key field in the Modbus TCP protocol. The deep
   inspection module is based on rule-based anomaly intrusion detection.
   Furthermore, we use the online test to evaluate the performance of our
   SD-IDS system. Our approach get a low rate of false positive and false
   negative.}},

Abstract = {{Until recently, industrial control systems (ICSs) used ``air-gap{''}
   security measures, where every node of the ICS network was isolated from
   other networks, including the Internet, by a physical disconnect.
   Attaching ICS networks to the Internet benefits companies and engineers
   who use them. However, as these systems were designed for use in the
   air-gapped security environment, protocols used by ICSs contain little
   to no security features and are vulnerable to various attacks. This
   paper proposes an approach to detect the intrusions into network
   attached ICSs by measuring and verifying data that is transmitted
   through the network but is not inherently the data used by the
   transmission protocol-network telemetry. Using simulated PLC units, the
   developed IDS was able to achieve 94.3 percent accuracy when
   differentiating between machines of an attacker and engineer on the same
   network, and 99.5 percent accuracy when differentiating between attacker
   and engineer on the Internet.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a process-oriented method for intrusion detection for
   use on Industrial Control System (ICS) networks. Network traffic from an
   ICS has a much lower volume than that from a typical IT enterprise
   network, and the traffic is much more regular (periodic) and
   predictable. Most intrusion detection systems for ICSs require
   additional capabilities. ICS network traffic is relatively predictable
   and regular and anomaly-based intrusion detection methods have been
   shown in the literature to work reasonably well. We use anomaly-based
   methods as one line of defense. We propose to strengthen ICS intrusion
   detection methods by adding two process-oriented alerting methods.
   Unlike most anomaly detection methods, these two methods are not
   configured solely by a network engineer based on inspection of network
   traffic. We utilize Critical Process Variables, which are defined by the
   plant operators themselves. The advantage is that the plant operators
   have the best knowledge of the critical assets of their system. Limiting
   values of the Critical Process Variables are defined collaboratively by
   the plant operator and the network security engineer. A network sensor
   then alerts a Human Analyst when Critical Process Variables values
   exceed the defined ranges. We also introduce a third method, which
   employs Process Network Parameter Metrics, which are also defined
   collaboratively with the plant operator. Process Network Parameter
   Metrics are pre-defined measurements from network traffic that may
   indicate that either process components are missing or there is
   additional traffic present that the process should not normally produce.
   After initial discussions with the plant operator, the network security
   engineer designs network models and metrics with appropriate alerting
   functions in the network sensor. Alerts from Process Network Parameter
   Metrics may not indicate a critical security incident as Critical
   Process Variables would, but they may provide an important warning that
   suspicious behavior is present.}},

Abstract = {{Current intrusion detection systems (IDS) for industrial control systems
   (ICS) mostly involve the retrofitting of conventional network IDSs, such
   as SNORT. Such an approach is prone to missing highly targeted and
   specific attacks against ICS. Where ICS-specific approaches exist, they
   often rely on passive network monitoring techniques, offering a low cost
   solution, and avoiding any computational overhead arising from actively
   polling ICS devices. However, the use of passive approaches alone could
   fail in the detection of attacks that alter the behaviour of ICS devices
   (as was the case in Stuxnet). Where active solutions exist, they can be
   resource-intensive, posing the risk of overloading legacy devices which
   are commonplace in ICSs. In this paper we aim to overcome these
   challenges through the combination of a passive network monitoring
   approach, and selective active monitoring based on attack vectors
   specific to an ICS context. We present the implementation of our IDS,
   SENAMI, for use with Siemens S7 devices. We evaluate the effectiveness
   of SENAMI in a comprehensive testbed environment, demonstrating validity
   of the proposed approach through the detection of purely passive attacks
   at a rate of 99\%, and active value tampering attacks at a rate of
   81-93\%. Crucially, we reach recall values greater than 0.96, indicating
   few attack scenarios generating false negatives.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the number of information security incidents of

   detection system for industrial control systems has received extensive

   Detection System, Snort has good expansibility and translatability, and
   can be used in various environments. However, Snort has clear deficiency
   on the intrusion detection of Profinet RT signal. Profinet DCP is an
   important part of Profinet RT. The intrusion detection for Profinet DCP
   is very important for the industry controlling systems which use
   Profinet to connect. To realize the detection for Profinet RT signal,
   this paper expanded the snort packet decoding engine, and designed a
   preprocessor plug-ins for Profinet RT signal. Experimental result shows
   that the improved Snort can support the intrusion detection for Profinet

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) networks are widely
   deployed in modern industrial control systems (ICSs) such as
   energy-delivery systems. As an increasing number of field devices and
   computing nodes get interconnected, network-based cyber attacks have
   become major cyber threats to ICS network infrastructure. Field devices
   and computing nodes in ICSs are subjected to both conventional network
   attacks and specialized attacks purposely crafted for SCADA network
   protocols. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based network
   intrusion detection system for SCADA networks to protect ICSs from both
   conventional and SCADA specific network-based attacks. Instead of
   relying on hand-crafted features for individual network packets or
   flows, our proposed approach employs a convolutional neural network
   (CNN) to characterize salient temporal patterns of SCADA traffic and
   identify time windows where network attacks are present. In addition, we
   design a re-training scheme to handle previously unseen network attack
   instances, enabling SCADA system operators to extend our neural network
   models with site-specific network attack traces. Our results using
   realistic SCADA traffic data sets show that the proposed
   deep-learning-based approach is well-suited for network intrusion
   detection in SCADA systems, achieving high detection accuracy and
   providing the capability to handle newly emerged threats.}},

   Detection in SCADA Systems}},

Abstract = {{Critical infrastructures, e.g., electricity generation and dispersal
   networks, chemical processing plants, and gas distribution, are governed
   and monitored by supervisory control and data acquisition systems
   (SCADA). Detecting intrusion is a prevalent area of study for numerous
   years, and several intrusion detection systems have been suggested in
   the literature for cyber-physical systems and industrial control system
   (ICS). In recent years, the viruses seismic net, duqu, and flame against
   ICS attacks have caused tremendous damage to nuclear facilities and
   critical infrastructure in some countries. These intensified attacks
   have sounded the alarm for the security of the ICS in many countries.
   The challenge in constructing an intrusion detection framework is to
   deal with unbalanced intrusion datasets, i.e. when one class is
   signified by a lesser amount of instances (minority class). To this end,
   we outline an approach to deal with this issue and propose an anomaly
   detection method for the ICS. Our proposed approach uses a hybrid model
   that takes advantage of the anticipated and consistent nature of
   communication patterns that occur among ground devices in ICS setups.
   First, we applied some preprocessing techniques to standardize and scale
   the data. Second, the dimensionality reduction algorithms are applied to
   improve the process of anomaly detection. Third, we employed an edited
   nearest-neighbor rule algorithm to balance the dataset. Fourth, by using
   the Bloom filter, a signature database is created by noting the system
   for a specific period lacking the occurrence of abnormalities. Finally,
   to detect new attacks, we combined our package contents-level detection
   with another instance-based learner to make a hybrid method for anomaly
   detection. The experimental results with a real large-scale dataset
   generated from a gas pipeline SCADA system show that the proposed
   approach HML-IDS outperforms the benchmark models with an accuracy rate
   of 97\%.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the increasing awareness of cyber-attacks against Critical
   Infrastructure (CI), safeguarding the Supervisory Control and Data
   Acquisition (SCADA) systems remains inadequate. For this purpose,
   designing an efficient SCADA Intrusion Detection System (IDS) becomes a
   significant research topic of the researchers to counter cyber-attacks.
   Most of the existing works present several statistical and machine
   learning approaches to prevent the SCADA network from the cyber-attacks.
   Whereas, these approaches failed to concern the most common challenge,
   ``Curse of dimensionality{''}. This scenario accentuates the necessity
   of an efficient feature selection algorithm in SCADA IDS where it
   identifies the relevant features and eliminates the redundant features
   without any loss of information. Hence, this paper proposes a novel
   filter-based feature selection approach for the identification of
   informative features based on Rough Set Theory and Hyper-clique based
   Binary Whale Optimization Algorithm (RST-HCBWoA). Experiments were
   carried out by Power system attack dataset and the performance of
   RST-HCBWoA was evaluated in terms of reduct size, precision, recall,
   classification accuracy, and time complexity.}},

   several critical infrastructures, they have connected to the internet.
   Consequently, SCADA systems face different sophisticated types of cyber
   adversaries. This paper suggests a Probability Risk Identification based
   Intrusion Detection System (PRI-IDS) technique based on analysing
   network traffic of Modbus TCP/IP for identifying replay attacks. It is
   acknowledged that Modbus TCP is usually vulnerable due to its
   unauthenticated and unencrypted nature. Our technique is evaluated using
   a simulation environment by configuring a testbed, which is a custom
   SCADA network that is cheap, accurate and scalable. The testbed is
   exploited when testing the IDS by sending individual packets from an
   attacker located on the same LAN as the Modbus master and slave. The
   experimental results demonstrated that the proposed technique can
   effectively and efficiently recognise replay attacks.}},

Abstract = {{Technological advancement of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and
   control systems automation over the past decade has brought greater
   interconnections of the control components. Modern control communication
   systems such as ModbusTCP are based on open standards that leverage
   Ethernet to allow interoperability between solutions from different
   vendors. The enhanced exchange of information has, as a side effect,
   created cyber security vulnerabilities such as entry points for hackers.
   Network monitoring typically applied to corporate networks is rarely
   implemented for ICS networks and should be mandatory for critical
   systems. Defense-in-Depth (DiD) is a concept that built on the premise
   of early detection and providing alerts of intrusions to guarantee that
   defensive action is taken prior to the breach of any critical assets.
   This paper validates the new intrusion detection based cyber-defensive
   architecture by using a Raspberry Pi based ModbusTCP control system that
   enables simulation of cyber-attacks, and illustrates a mitigation
   measure with the added feature of Modbus monitoring using Snort.}},

Abstract = {{Intentional attacks(1) that cause country wide blackouts, gas and water
   systems malfunction are actions that can be carried out by a nation to
   impact on another nation in a mean of war. Supervisory control and data
   acquisition (SCADA) networks that allow for communication for the
   utilities companies were designed with no security in mind causing the
   systems that a nation relies on to fall vulnerable to exploitation.
   Since SCADA networks are static in nature with pre-defined signatures of
   network traffic, we propose to design an anomaly-based intrusion
   detection system to detect abnormality in SCADA network traffic and
   protocols. We gather normal SCADA network traffic via tapping on the
   network for 30 days and then attack the network using Denial of Service
   (DoS) attack, message spoofing attack and man-in-the middle attack. We
   then train a classifier with two classes, normal and abnormal and report
   the classifier accuracy in detecting abnormal SCADA network traffic.}},

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems complexity and
   interconnectivity increase in recent years have exposed the SCADA
   networks to numerous potential vulnerabilities. Several studies have
   shown that anomaly-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) achieves
   improved performance to identify unknown or zero-day attacks. In this
   paper, we propose a hybrid model for anomaly-based intrusion detection
   in SCADA networks using machine learning approach. In the first part, we
   present a robust hybrid model for anomaly-based intrusion detection in
   SCADA networks. Finally, we present a feature selection model for
   anomaly-based intrusion detection in SCADA networks by removing
   redundant and irrelevant features. Irrelevant features in the dataset
   can affect modeling power and reduce predictive accuracy. These models
   were evaluated using an industrial control system dataset developed at
   the Distributed Analytics and Security Institute Mississippi State
   University Starkville, MS, USA. The experimental results show that our
   proposed model has a key effect in reducing the time and computational
   complexity and achieved improved accuracy and detection rate. The
   accuracy of our proposed model was measured as 99.5 \% for
   specific-attack-labeled.}},

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems face the
   absence of a protection technique that can beat different types of
   intrusions and protect the data from disclosure while handling this data
   using other applications, specifically Intrusion Detection System (IDS).
   The SCADA system can manage the critical infrastructure of industrial
   control environments. Protecting sensitive information is a difficult
   task to achieve in reality with the connection of physical and digital
   systems. Hence, privacy preservation techniques have become effective in
   order to protect sensitive/private information and to detect malicious
   activities, but they are not accurate in terms of error detection,
   sensitivity percentage of data disclosure. In this paper, we propose a
   new Privacy Preservation Intrusion Detection (PPID) technique based on
   the correlation coefficient and Expectation Maximisation (EM) clustering
   mechanisms for selecting important portions of data and recognizing
   intrusive events. This technique is evaluated on the power system
   datasets for multiclass attacks to measure its reliability for detecting
   suspicious activities. The experimental results outperform three
   techniques in the above terms, showing the efficiency and effectiveness
   of the proposed technique to be utilized for current SCADA systems.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial Control and SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)
   networks control critical infrastructure such as power plants, nuclear
   facilities, and water supply systems. These systems are increasingly the
   target of cyber attacks by threat actors of different kinds, with
   successful attacks having the potential to cause damage, cost and
   injury/loss of life. As a result, there is a strong need for enhanced
   tools to detect cyber threats in SCADA networks. This paper makes a
   number of contributions to advance research in this area. First, we
   study the level of support for SCADA protocols in well-known open source
   intrusion detection systems (IDS). Second, we select a specific IDS,
   Suricata, and enhance it to include support for detecting threats
   against SCADA systems running the EtherNet/IP (ENIP) industrial control
   protocol. Finally, we conduct a traffic-based study to evaluate the
   performance of the new ENIP module in Suricata - analyzing its
   performance in low performance hardware systems.}},

Abstract = {{Modern Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems used by
   the electric utility industry to monitor and control electric power
   generation, transmission and distribution are recognized today as
   critical components of the electric power delivery infrastructure. SCADA
   systems are large, complex and incorporate increasing numbers of widely
   distributed components. The presence of a real time intrusion detection
   mechanism, which can cope with different types of attacks, is of great
   importance in order to defend a system against cyber attacks. This
   defense mechanism must be distributed, cheap and above all accurate,
   since false positive alarms or mistakes regarding the origin of the
   intrusion mean severe costs for the system. Recently an integrated
   detection mechanism, namely IT-OCSVM, was proposed, which is distributed
   in a SCADA network as a part of a distributed intrusion detection system
   (DIDS), providing accurate data about the origin and the time of an
   intrusion. In this paper we also analyze the architecture of the
   integrated detection mechanism and we perform extensive simulations
   based on real cyber attacks in a small SCADA testbed in order to
   evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Security of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems
   remains a vital issue due to the criticality of the systems they
   control. They are used in various critical infrastructures, including
   electric power, oil \& gas and others. The protocols used in this domain
   were designed to satisfy operational requirements without much
   consideration for security issues. Most SCADA protocols in use today
   have the ability to transport control messages over TCP/IP networks,
   leaving them open to attacks that may have a catastrophic impact on the
   physical systems they control. This paper describes a research effort to
   improve the current state intrusion detection solutions for SCADA
   systems. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) used in this domain are
   typically extensions of IT tools, such as Snort, that have been extended
   with generic static signatures. The main limitation of this approach is
   its inability to adapt to system changes and it only offers partial
   support for deep-packet inspection. The proposed approach improves on
   existing IDS solutions by developing a framework that allows (i) dynamic
   rule generation and (ii) fine-tuned deep-packet inspection. A simple
   language grammar allows network engineers to describe system
   characteristics that include network topology, protocol and the roles of
   the different control nodes. A compiler, instrumented with
   SCADA-specific semantic rules, recognizes monitoring needs and generates
   network signatures that are specific to the system monitored by the IDS.
   An organization using our approach has the ability to adapt to system
   changes by simply updating the system description and its monitoring
   needs.}},

Abstract = {{Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is a vital
   component of critical infrastructures (CIs). However, most protocols in
   SCADA systems lack either authentication or integrity checking
   mechanisms, which makes them extremely vulnerable to cyber attacks when
   increasingly more SCADA systems are connected with external networks.
   Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been proposed to enhance the
   system security, but few of them can effectively resist response
   injection and denial of service attacks at the same time. In this paper
   we present an IDS named PT-IDS to fill this gap by investigating the
   periodicity and telemetry patterns of network traffic within typical
   SCADA systems. Firstly, we analyze the periodicity characteristics in
   SCADA networks and classify them into four categories through designing
   an analyzer algorithm. Furthermore, in order to effectively detect
   response injection attacks, we design an auxiliary module to analyze the
   network telemetry pattern. Results from both modules are considered
   simultaneously to promote the accuracy of intrusion detection,
   especially for denial of service attacks. Beyond that, our proposed
   system can give alarm reports including both warnings and matching
   severity information. The time complexity of both analyzer algorithms is
   polynomial and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency
   of our IDS mechanism.}},

   There is a growing emphasis towards developing an efficient intrusion
   detection system (IDS) to strengthen the security of the SCADA control
   system. This is a research-in-progress paper which presents the
   application of two anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (AbIDS) in
   detecting the stealthy cyber-attack on the SCADA control system. We have
   applied the IDS tools Snort and Bro, in designing the IDS and later,
   compared their performances in terms of detection rate and latency in
   the alert packets with a motive of selecting better IDS for the SCADA
   security. Specifically, the timing-based rule is applied to identify the
   malicious packets based on the high temporal frequency in the network
   traffic. For the case study, we have implemented the SCADA based
   protection scheme which performs an autonomous protection to mitigate
   the system disturbances. We first implemented the stealthy cyber-attack
   which compromised the SCADA controller followed by data integrity attack
   on the system generator. Next, we perform the impact analysis during the
   attack followed by performance evaluation of IDS tools. Our experimental
   results show that the IDS tools are efficient in detecting cyber-attacks
   within an acceptable time frame for different sizes of network packets.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber threats in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
   systems have the potential to render physical damage and jeopardize
   power system operation, safety and stability. SCADA systems were
   originally designed with little consideration of escalating cyber
   threats and hence the problem of how to develop robust intrusion
   detection technologies to tailor the requirements of SCADA is an
   emerging topic and a big challenge. This paper proposes a stateful
   Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)
   method to improve the cyber-security of SCADA systems using the IEC
   60870-5-104 protocol which is tailored for basic telecontrol
   communications. The proposed stateful protocol analysis approach is
   presented that is designed specifically for the IEC 60870-5-104
   protocol. Finally, the novel intrusion detection approach are
   implemented and validated.}},

Abstract = {{SCADA systems, an acronym for Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition
   (supervisory, Control and data acquisition), are control networks that
   allow the monitoring and management of industrial processes remotely. In
   the beginning, their top priority was the availability of information
   bidirectionally between the control station and the remote units;
   however, the growing escalation of industrial systems, as well as
   internet connectivity has led to reconsider the old paradigm to give
   more importance to the issue of security, in order to avoid a possible
   cyber-attack endangers the functioning of the SCADA system. These
   attacks can affect even the industry and put into risk the security of a
   country. The present paper proposes the creation of an adaptive system
   for the detection of intruders or IDS (for its acronym in English) on
   SCADA networks, through the use of supervised machine learning
   techniques, oriented to the analysis of variables of the control
   devices. A support vector of type ``Class One{''} machine and a test
   lab, allowed the validation of the proposed model.}},

Abstract = {{Intrusion detection in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
   systems is of major importance nowadays. Most of the systems are
   designed without cyber security in mind, since interconnection with
   other systems through unsafe channels, is becoming the rule during last
   years. The de-isolation of SCADA systems make them vulnerable to
   attacks, disrupting its correct functioning and tampering with its
   normal operation.
   In this paper we present a intrusion detection module capable of
   detecting malicious network traffic in a SCADA (Supervisory Control and
   Data Acquisition) system, based on the combination of One-Class Support
   Vector Machine (OCSVM) with RBF kernel and recursive k-means clustering.
   The combination of OCSVM with recursive k-means clustering leads the
   proposed intrusion detection module to distinguish real alarms from
   possible attacks regardless of the values of parameters sigma and v,
   making it ideal for real-time intrusion detection mechanisms for SCADA
   systems. The OCSVM module developed is trained by network traces off

Abstract = {{The massive use of information and communication technologies in
   supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems opens new ways
   for carrying out cyberattacks against critical infrastructures relying
   on SCADA networks. The various vulnerabilities in these systems and the
   heterogeneity of cyberattacks make the task extremely difficult for
   traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS). Modeling cyberattacks has
   become nearly impossible and their potential consequences may be very
   severe. The primary objective of this work is to detect malicious
   intrusions once they have already bypassed traditional IDS and
   firewalls. This paper investigates the use of machine learning for
   intrusion detection in SCADA systems using one-class classification
   algorithms. Two approaches of one-class classification are investigated:
   1) the support vector data description (SVDD); and 2) the kernel
   principle component analysis. The impact of the considered metric is
   examined in detail with the study of l(p)-norms in radial basis function
   (RBF) kernels. A heuristic is proposed to find an optimal choice of the
   bandwidth parameter in these kernels. Tests are conducted on real data
   with several types of cyberattacks.}},

   may impact the health and safety of the employees and the citizens
   living in the area. The diversity of cyberattacks and the complexity of
   the studied systems make modeling cyberattacks very difficult or even
   impossible. This paper outlines the importance of one-class
   classification in detecting intrusions in SCADA systems. Two approaches
   are investigated, the Support Vector Data Description and the Kernel
   Principal Component Analysis. A case study on a gas pipeline testbed is
   provided with real data containing many types of cyberattacks.}},

Abstract = {{The vital role Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems
   play in controlling the modern infrastructure; along with the rapid
   evolution of these systems have turned them into one of the most desired
   targets for malicious attackers. Moreover, SCADA-specific attacks are
   becoming more sophisticated, and yet security measures are deployed at a
   very slow pace. In this work, we present a SCADA-specific Intrusion
   Detection System (IDS) that detects SCADA attacks based on their network
   traffic behavior, namely the temporal behavior of frequent patterns of
   the SCADA protocols. The IDS raises alarms when abnormal behavior is
   identified. The results showed that the IDS is able to detect attacks at
   a high rate while keeping false alarms at a minimum rate.}},

Abstract = {{The Modbus/TCP protocol is commonly used in SCADA systems for
   communications between a human-machine interface (HMI) and programmable
   logic controllers (PLCs). This paper presents a model-based intrusion
   detection system designed specifically for Modbus/TCP networks. The
   approach is based on the key observation that Modbus traffic to and from
   a specific PLC is highly periodic; as a result, each HMI-PLC channel can
   be modeled using its own unique deterministic finite automaton (DFA). An
   algorithm is presented that can automatically construct the DFA
   associated with an HMI-PLC channel based on about 100 captured messages.
   The resulting DFA-based intrusion detection system looks deep into
   Modbus/TCP packets and produces a very detailed traffic model. This
   approach is very sensitive and is able to flag anomalies such as a
   message appearing out of its position in the normal sequence or a
   message referring to a single unexpected bit. The intrusion detection
   approach is tested on a production Modbus system. Despite its high
   sensitivity, the system has a very low false positive rate-perfect
   matches of the model to the traffic were observed for five of the seven
   PLCs tested without a single false alarm over 111 h of operation.
   Furthermore, the intrusion detection system successfully flagged real
   anomalies that were caused by technicians who were troubleshooting the
   HMI system. The system also helped identify a PLC that was configured
   incorrectly. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are a salient
   part of the control and monitoring of critical infrastructures such as
   electricity generation, distribution, water treatment and distribution,
   and gas and oil production. Recently, such systems have increased their
   connectivity by using public networks and standard protocols (e. g.
   TCP/IP). However, while enhancing productivity, this will expose these
   systems to cyber threat. This is because many widely-used protocols in
   these systems such as MODBUS, DNP3 and EtherNET/IP are lacking
   authentication, and therefore command injection and data injection are
   potential threat. An unsupervised intrusion detection technique (with
   unlabelled data) is an appropriate method to address this issue because
   labelling the huge amount of data produced by such systems is a costly
   and time-consuming process. However, unsupervised learning algorithms
   suffer from low detection accuracy. This paper proposes a framework that
   can be used as an add-on component for any unsupervised approach to
   improve its performance. Experimental results confirm that the framework
   demonstrated a significant improvement in three unsupervised intrusion
   detection algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Most SCADA and industrial control systems have a limited and
   deterministic set of behaviors that results with a relatively small
   amount of variability during normal system operation. Automatic
   controller commands, operator commands and sensor measurement data
   within the system may be modified by an attacker to cause system
   failures. To detect these intrusions a Transfer Function based Intrusion
   Detection System (TFIDS) is proposed in this paper. Normal operational
   behaviors can be modeled and integrated into the TFIDS with alarm
   filtering and reporting rules. Trust anchors within the system are
   required to collect some of the signals, ensure the signal integrity
   when delivered to the TFIDS, and to host the TFIDS if physical attacks
   are a concern. This paper provides an overview of the TFIDS and
   simulation results for attacks on a waste water treatment system with
   and without the TFIDS.}},

Abstract = {{Increased complexity and interconnectivity of Supervisory Control and
   Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems in Smart Grids potentially means
   greater susceptibility to malicious attackers. SCADA systems with legacy
   communication infrastructure have inherent cyber-security
   vulnerabilities as these systems were originally designed with little
   consideration of cyber threats. In order to improve cyber-security of
   SCADA networks, this paper presents a rule-based Intrusion Detection
   System (IDS) using a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) method, which includes
   signature-based and model-based approaches tailored for SCADA systems.
   The proposed signature-based rules can accurately detect several known
   suspicious or malicious attacks. In addition, model-based detection is
   proposed as a complementary method to detect unknown attacks. Finally,
   proposed intrusion detection approaches for SCADA networks are
   implemented and verified via Snort rules.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced false data injection attack in targeted malware intrusion is
   becoming an emerging severe threat to the Supervisory Control And Data
   Acquisition (SCADA) system. Several intrusion detection schemes have
   been proposed previously {[}1, 2]. However, designing an effective
   real-time detection system for a resource-constraint device is still an
   open problem for the research community. In this paper, we propose a new
   relation-graph-based detection scheme to defeat false data injection
   attacks at the SCADA system, even when injected data may seemly fall
   within a valid/normal range. To balance effectiveness and efficiency, we
   design a novel detection model, alternation vectors with state relation
   graph. Furthermore, we propose a new inference algorithm to infer the
   injection point(s), i.e., the attack origin, in the system. We evaluate
   SRID with a real-world power plant simulator. The experiment results
   show that SRID can detect various false data injection attacks with a
   low false positive rate at 0.0125\%. Meanwhile, SRID can dramatically
   reduce the search space of attack origins and accurately locate most of
   attack origins.}},

Abstract = {{The merging of power grid, information, and communication technology

   paper, the graphical detection technology which uses Graph Network (GN)
   is developed for detecting tampered measurements without external

   detection of FDI attacks location issue from the diversified
   dimensionality in power systems, the Capsule Network combined with GN is
   developed, which can extract preserve the detailed properties around
   each note such as location, direction, connection, etc. To evaluate the
   superior performance of proposed method, the proposed detection
   technology is carried out through standard IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus
   systems. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can
   detect FDI attacks accurately with different attack sparsity and

Title = {{Optimal periodic watermarking schedule for replay attack detection in

Journal = {{AUTOMATICA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{112}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We consider periodic watermarking scheduling for detecting discontinuous
   replay attacks in Cyber- Physical Systems (CPSs). The existing methods
   of imposing continuous watermarks on the nominal control inputs may
   result in the waste of control cost when system detectors are not
   sensitive to the added watermarks, since the attacker may be absent for
   a considerably long time. For example, in the famous Stuxnet event, the
   attacker only launches the attack for a short period each month in order
   to avoid being detected. In this paper, we firstly formulate a one-time
   attack duration model for such discontinuous replay attacks. Then, by
   exploiting the attack model, we propose a periodic watermarking strategy
   which aims to reduce the control cost. Furthermore, we obtain an optimal
   periodic watermarking strategy for the approximate detection
   performance. Extensive simulations over a quadruple water tank system
   are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

Abstract = {{The introduction of the cyber-physical system (CPS) into power systems
   has created a variety of communication requirements and functions that
   existing legacy systems do not support. To this end, the IEEE 1815.1
   standard defines the mapping between existing distributed network
   protocol networks and IEC 61850 networks that reflect new requirements.
   However, advanced CPS cyberattacks have been reported, and in order to
   address cyberattacks, security research on new power systems that use
   network devices and heterogeneous communication is necessary. In this
   study, we propose an intrusion detection system for an IEEE 1815.1-based
   power system using CPS. We 1) analyze an IEEE 1815.1-based power system
   network and propose a suitable application method for an intrusion
   detection system, 2) suggest a bidirectional recurrent neural
   network-based anomaly detection system for an IEEE 1815.1-based network,
   and 3) demonstrate the verification of the proposed technique using
   various power system-specific attack data, including real power system
   using CPS network traffic, CPS malware behavior (CMB), false data
   injection (FDI), and disabling reassembly (DR) attacks. Proposed
   technique successfully detected five types of CMB attacks, three types
   of FDI and DR attacks.}},

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) play a significant role in our critical
   infrastructure networks from power-distribution to utility networks. The
   emerging smart-grid concept is a compelling critical CPS infrastructure
   that relies on two-way communications between smart devices to increase
   efficiency, enhance reliability, and reduce costs. However, compromised
   devices in the smart grid poses several security challenges.
   Consequences of propagating fake data or stealing sensitive smart grid
   information via compromised devices are costly. Hence, early behavioral
   detection of compromised devices is critical for protecting the smart
   grid's components and data. To address these concerns, in this article,
   we introduce a novel and configurable system-level framework to identify
   compromised smart grid devices. The framework combines system and
   function call tracing techniques with signal processing and statistical
   analysis to detect compromised devices based on their behavioral
   characteristics. We measure the efficacy of our framework with a
   realistic smart grid substation testbed that includes both
   resource-limited and resource-rich devices. In total, using our
   framework, we analyze six different types of compromised device
   scenarios with different resources and attack payloads. To the best of
   our knowledge, the proposed framework is the first in detecting
   compromised CPS smart grid devices with system and function-level call
   tracing techniques. The experimental results reveal an excellent rate
   for the detection of compromised devices. Specifically, performance
   metrics include accuracy values between 95\% and 99\% for the different
   attack scenarios. Finally, the performance analysis demonstrates that
   the use of the proposed framework has minimal overhead on the smart grid
   devices' computing resources.}},

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are a critical
   part of large industrial facilities, such as water distribution
   infrastructures. With the goal of reducing costs and increasing
   efficiency, these systems are becoming increasingly interconnected.
   However, tins has also exposed them to a wide range of network security
   problems. Our research focus on the development of a novel flow-based
   intrusion detection system. Based on the assumption that SCADA networks
   are well-behaved, we believe that it is possible to model the normal
   traffic by establishing relations between network flows. To improve
   accuracy and provide more information on the anomalous traffic, we will
   also research methods to derive a flow-based model for anomalous flows.}},

Abstract = {{This article proposes a hybrid intelligent-classic control approach for
   reconstruction and compensation of cyber attacks launched on inputs of
   nonlinear cyber-physical systems (CPS) and industrial Internet of Things
   systems, which work through shared communication networks. In this
   article, a class of n-order nonlinear systems is considered as a model
   of CPS while it is in presence of cyber attacks only in the forward
   channel. An intelligent-classic control system is developed to
   compensate cyber-attacks. Neural network (NN) is designed as an
   intelligent estimator for attack estimation and a classic nonlinear
   control system based on the variable structure control method is
   designed to compensate the effect of attacks and control the system
   performance in tracking applications. In the proposed strategy,
   nonlinear control theory is applied to guarantee the stability of the
   system when attacks happen. In this strategy, a Gaussian radial basis
   function NN is used for online estimation and reconstruction of
   cyber-attacks launched on the networked system. An adaptation law of the
   intelligent estimator is derived from a Lyapunov function. Simulation
   results demonstrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed
   strategy in car cruise control application as the testbed.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding potential behaviors of attackers is of paramount
   importance for improving the cybersecurity of power systems. However,
   the attack behaviors in existing studies are often modeled statically on
   a single snapshot, which neglects the reality of a dynamically
   time-evolving power system. Accordingly, a dynamic cyber-attack model
   with local network information is proposed to characterize the typical
   data injection attack with the integration of potential dynamic
   behaviors of an attacker. The proposed model collaboratively alters the
   meter measurement in a stealthy way to illegally contaminate the system
   state, thus posing severe threats to cyber physical power systems. We
   then develop a novel anomaly detection countermeasure from the
   perspective of state estimation to effectively recognize the dynamic
   injection attack. In this countermeasure, an interval state forecasting
   method is proposed to approximate the possible largest variation bounds
   of each state variable based on a worst-case analysis considering the
   forecasting uncertainties of renewable energy sources, electric loads,
   and network parameter perturbations. In addition, the kernel quantile
   regression is introduced and implemented to formulate the uncertainties
   in renewable energy and electric load forecast as a series of confidence
   intervals. When any state variable falls outside its preforecasted
   intervals, the proposed countermeasure detects the anomaly and sets an
   alarm condition indicating the possibility of data contamination.
   Finally, the results from our extensive studies on several IEEE standard
   test systems have been presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the
   dynamic attack and the effectiveness of the detection countermeasure.}},

Title = {{Unscented Kalman Filter based interval state estimation of cyber
   physical energy system for detection of dynamic attack}},
Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{188}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Information and communication technologies (ICTs) introduce many
   Internet-based entry points that pose potential risks to cyber physical
   energy system (CPES). Therefore, it is significant to enhance the
   cybersecurity of CPES from cyber-attacks. In this paper, a new dynamic
   attack model that takes into account the dynamic characteristics of
   energy systems is developed based on traditional false data injection
   attack. The proposed attack model can be used to describe the attack
   behaviors of a malicious attacker over time. Then, we propose a new
   generalized interval state estimator to quantify the normal fluctuations
   of all CPES state variables. In this state estimator, the Unscented
   Kalman Filter (UKF) is used to predict the real-time operating level of
   the state variables. Copula theory is introduced to model the prediction
   uncertainty of sustainable energy and load as a set of conditional
   quantiles. We then model the normal fluctuation range of each CPES state
   as a bilevel nonlinear programming problem based on the worst case
   analysis. Consequently, an anomaly detection method is developed to
   detect whether there is an attack or not in the CPES. In this method,
   any state variable that falls outside its estimated interval is
   considered an abnormal point. Finally, the feasibility of the dynamic
   attack model and the effectiveness of the anomaly detection method have
   been extensively validated on test systems in power and energy society
   of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). (C)

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) security has become a critical research
   topic as more and more CPS applications are making increasing impacts in
   diverse industrial sectors. Due to the tight interaction between cyber
   and physical components, CPS security requires a different strategy from
   the traditional information technology (IT) security. In this paper, we
   propose a machine learning-based attack detection (AD) scheme, as part
   of our overall CPS security strategies. The proposed scheme performs AD
   at the physical layer by modeling and monitoring physics or physical
   behavior of the physical asset or process. In developing the proposed AD
   scheme, we devote our efforts on intelligently deriving salient
   signatures or features out of the large number of noisy physical
   measurements by leveraging physical knowledge and using advanced machine
   learning techniques. Such derived features not only capture the physical
   relationships among the measurements but also have more discriminant
   power in distinguishing normal and attack activities. In our
   experimental study for demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed
   AD scheme, we consider heavy-duty gas turbines of combined cycle power
   plants as the CPS application. Using the data from both the
   high-fidelity simulation and several real plants, we demonstrate that
   our proposed AD scheme is effective in early detection of attacks or
   malicious activities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with secure state estimation of cyber-physical systems
   subject to switching (on/off) attack signals and injection of fake
   packets (via either packet substitution or insertion of extra packets).
   The random set paradigm is adopted in order to model, via random finite
   sets (RFSs), the switching nature of both system attacks and the
   injection of fake measurements. The problem of detecting an attack on
   the system and jointly estimating its state, possibly in the presence of
   fake measurements, is then formulated and solved in the Bayesian
   framework for systems with and without direct feedthrough of the attack
   input to the output. This leads to the analytical derivation of a hybrid
   Bernoulli filter (HBF) that updates in real time the joint posterior
   density of a Bernoulli attack RFS and of the state vector. A closed-form
   Gaussian mixture implementation of the proposed HBF is fully derived in
   the case of invertible direct feedthrough. Finally, the effectiveness of
   the developed tools for joint attack detection and secure state
   estimation is tested on two case studies concerning a benchmark system
   for unknown input estimation and a standard IEEE power network
   application.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the security problems in cyber-physical systems (CPSs)
   against replay attack are considered. With replay attacks, attacker
   records and covers the transmitted data between the senders and
   receivers of the sensors. In order to achieve the detection objective
   for malicious replay attacks, the stochastic coding scheme is proposed
   to make the CPSs generate covariance differences between the normal and
   compromised data. Different from the existing results, this method
   detects the replay attack without sacrificing any system performances in
   normal systems. Based on the coding scheme, two types of detectors are
   further designed to detect the covariance changes in residual and
   output, respectively. Moreover, the output-based detector has more
   low-computing solution process than the residual-based one. Finally, a
   practical example is proposed to demonstrate the superiority of the
   stochastic coding scheme. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a frequency-based approach for the detection of
   replay attacks affecting cyber-physical systems (CPS). In particular,
   the method employs a sinusoidal signal with a time-varying frequency
   (authentication signal) into the closed-loop system and checks whether
   the time profile of the frequency components in the output signal are
   compatible with the authentication signal or not. In order to carry out
   this target, the couplings between inputs and outputs are eliminated
   using a dynamic decoupling technique based on vector fitting. In this
   way, a signature introduced on a specific input channel will affect only
   the output that is selected to be associated with that input, which is a
   property that can be exploited to determine which channels are being
   affected. A bank of band-pass filters is used to generate signals whose
   energies can be compared to reconstruct an estimation of the
   time-varying frequency profile. By matching the known frequency profile
   with its estimation, the detector can provide the information about
   whether a replay attack is being carried out or not. The design of the
   signal generator and the detector are thoroughly discussed, and an
   example based on a quadruple-tank process is used to show the
   application and effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2019 The

Abstract = {{These days, cyber attacks against cyber-physical systems (CPS) such as
   power plants are constantly growing, and therefore the countermeasures
   are essential. Whitelisting cyber attack detection, that detects
   anomalous activity as deviation from normal network communication, is
   especially attracting attention as one of the countermeasures because
   the traffic patterns are predictable in CPS. However, attackers can
   execute illegal operations within the normal network communication
   defined as the whitelisting detection rules because such operations tend
   to cause unstable control depending on operational states. In this work,
   we propose a new whitelisting cyber attack detection method that
   estimates the operational state of CPS and monitors the CPS network with
   the whitelisting detection rules according to the estimated state. The
   proposed method can define the more limited normal network communication
   to generate the whitelisting detection rules in each operational state.
   We experimented and evaluated the method on a plant simulator, and
   confirmed the effectiveness of the method: state estimation with support
   vector machine and attack detection with divided whitelisting detection
   rules.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the effect of replay attacks on constrained
   cyber-physical systems which are subject to linear probabilistic
   constraints. In order to inject an exogenous control input without being
   detected the attacker will hijack the sensors, observe and record their
   readings for a certain amount of time and repeat them afterwards while
   carrying out his attack. The conditions under which the attacker can
   induce perturbation in the control loop without being detected is
   studied. Then, in order to make the system resilient to the replay
   attack, a random signal (serving as the authentication signal) is added
   to the control input. Since this signal can hamper the performance of
   the system, finally, the optimization of the authentication signals is
   proposed to maximize the detection rate while keeping the process
   deterioration bounded. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is
   demonstrated on a simulated case study.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic state estimation, enabled by phasor measurement units (PMUs),
   opens new opportunities to improve detection of cyber-physical attacks
   in power networks. Distributed approaches to estimation and attack
   detection have many advantages, such as reduced processing times and
   increased security, and are arguably necessary for large size networks.
   In this work, we present a fully-distributed dynamic state estimation
   algorithm using PMU measurement data. The dynamic state estimation is
   jointly designed with an innovation-based attack detection scheme to
   limit communication overhead. An attractive feature of our work is that
   each control area utilizes a local model of reduced dimension. The
   design of our algorithm uses an approximation to the state covariance
   matrix, which allows for a trade-off between computation, communication,
   and accuracy. In numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness

Abstract = {{The networking of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is a worldwide trend.
   With the growing accessibility of data vulnerability to attacks
   increases. Recent cyber attacks like Triton point out the necessity of
   new methods to secure CPS. Despite multiple dissimilarities between CPS
   and a general IT system, the mature field of IT security can inspire new
   methods for the protection of CPS such as cryptography. The encryption
   of signals transferring through the network is not new. The homomorphic
   encryption scheme allows execution of mathematical operations in the
   encrypted domain. This allows to encrypt not only signals in the network
   but also parameters and variables of a remote monitoring system. In this
   way, it is much more difficult for the adversary to gather information
   about the plant to execute a stealthy attack. In this paper, a somewhat
   homomorphic encryption scheme is applied to a CPS to ensure safe and
   secure communication by protecting all signals and variables in the
   network without loss of performance. A numerical example demonstrates
   the security level that can he achieved by applying this scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Smart water infrastructures are prone to cyber-physical attacks that can
   disrupt their operations or damage their assets. An algorithm was
   developed to identify suspicious behaviors in the different
   cyber-physical components of a smart water distribution system. The

   and control data. Trained artificial neural networks were used to detect
   unusual patterns that do not conform to normal operational behavior.
   Principal component analysis was conducted to decompose the
   high-dimensional space occupied by the sensory data to uncover global
   anomalies. The algorithm was trained using a historical data set of
   trusted observations and tested against a validation and a test data
   set, both featuring a group of simulated attack scenarios. The proposed
   approach successfully identified all the attacks featured in the Battle

Abstract = {{The violation of data integrity in automotive Cyber-Physical Systems
   (CPS) may lead to dangerous situations for drivers and pedestrians in
   terms of safety. In particular, cyber-attacks on the sensor could easily
   degrade data accuracy and consistency over any other attack, we
   investigate attack detection and identification based on a deep learning
   technology on wheel speed sensors of automotive CPS. For faster recovery
   of a physical system with detection of the cyber-attacks, estimation of
   a specific value is conducted to substitute false data. To the best of
   our knowledge, there has not been a case of joining sensor attack
   detection and vehicle speed estimation in existing literature. In this
   work, we design a novel method to combine attack detection and
   identification, vehicle speed estimation of wheel speed sensors to
   improve the safety of CPS even under the attacks. First, we define
   states of the sensors based on the cases of attacks that can occur in
   the sensors. Second, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is applied to detect
   and identify wheel speed sensor attacks. Third, in order to estimate the
   vehicle speeds accurately, we employ Weighted Average (WA), as one of
   the fusion algorithms, in order to assign a different weight to each
   sensor. Since environment uncertainty while driving has an impact on
   different characteristics of vehicles and causes performance
   degradation, the recovery mechanism needs the ability adaptive to
   changing environments. Therefore, we estimate the vehicle speeds after
   assigning a different weight to each sensor depending on driving
   situations classified by analyzing driving data. Experiments including
   training, validation, and test are carried out with actual measurements
   obtained while driving on the real road. In case of the fault detection
   and identification, classification accuracy is evaluated. Mean Squared
   Error (MSE) is calculated to verify that the speed is estimated
   accurately. The classification accuracy about test additive attack data
   is 99.4978\%. MSE of our proposed speed estimation algorithm is 1.7786.
   It is about 0.2 lower than MSEs of other algorithms. We demonstrate that
   our system maintains data integrity well and is safe relatively in
   comparison with systems which apply other algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses a set-theoretic method for the detection of data
   corruption cyber-attacks on the load frequency control loop of a
   networked power system. The system consists of several interconnected
   control areas forming a power grid. Based on the overall discrete-time
   network dynamics, a convex and compact polyhedral robust invariant set
   is extracted and is used as a set-induced anomaly detector. If the state
   vector exits the invariant set, then an alarm will be activated, and the
   potential threat is considered disclosed. The attack scenario used to
   assess the efficiency of the proposed anomaly detector concerns
   corrupted frequency sensor measurements transmitted to the automatic
   generation control unit of a compromised control area. Simulation
   studies highlight the ability of a set-theoretic approach to disclose
   persistent and intermittent attack patterns even when they occur at the
   same time with changes in the power load demand.}},

   WDSs combined with an anomaly detection algorithm for the identification
   of complex cyberattacks that cannot be fully identified by hydraulically

Abstract = {{The use of control-theoretic solutions to detect attacks against
   cyber-physical industrial systems is a growing area of research.
   Traditional literature proposes the use of control strategies to retain,
   eg, satisfactory close-loop performance, as well as safety properties,
   when a communication network connects the distributed components of a
   physical system (eg, sensors, actuators, and controllers). However, the
   adaptation of these strategies to handle security incidents is an
   ongoing challenge. In this paper, we survey the advantages of a
   watermark-based detector against some integrity attacks as well as the
   weaknesses against other attacks. To cover these weaknesses, we propose
   a new control and security strategy that complements the watermark-based
   detector. We validate the detection efficiency of the new strategy via
   numeric simulation. Experimental results are also presented by using a
   laboratory testbed based on supervisory control and data acquisition
   industrial protocols.}},

   However, the proposed methods for subsequent isolation and correction
   faced limitations due to delays or lack of information to pinpoint the

Abstract = {{A developing trend of traditional industrial systems is the integration
   of the cyber and physical domain to improve flexibility and the
   efficiency of supervision, management, and control. But, the deep
   integration of these industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs),
   increases the potential for security threats. Attack detection, which
   forms initial protective barrier, plays an important role in overall
   security protection. However, most traditional methods focused on cyber
   information and ignored any limitations that might arise from the
   characteristics of the physical domain. In this paper, an anomaly
   detection approach based on zone partition is designed for ICPSs. In
   detail, initially an automated zone partition method, ensuring crucial
   system states can be observed in more than one zone, is designed. Then,
   methods of building zone function model, which do not require any prior
   knowledge of the physical system are presented before analyzing the
   anomaly based on zone information. Finally, an experimental rig is
   constructed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The
   results demonstrate that the approach presents a high-accuracy solution,
   which also performs effectively in real time.}},

   insecure channel is used for communications. By taking advantage of the
   main features of the Command Governor (CG) control paradigm, a simple
   Detector module is designed to detect cyber-attacks that might affect

Abstract = {{While the ever-increasing connectivity of cyber-physical systems
   enlarges their attack surface, existing anomaly detection frameworks
   often do not incorporate the rising heterogeneity of involved systems.
   Existing frameworks focus on a single fieldbus protocol or require more
   detailed knowledge of the cyber-physical system itself. Thus, we
   introduce a uniform method and framework for applying anomaly detection
   to a variety of fieldbus protocols. We use stacked denoising
   autoencoders to derive a feature learning and packet classification
   method in one step. As the approach is based on the raw byte stream of
   the network traffic, neither specific protocols nor detailed knowledge
   of the application is needed. Additionally, we pay attention on creating
   an efficient framework which can also handle the increased amount of
   communication in cyber-physical systems.
   Our evaluation on a Secure Water Treatment dataset using EtherNet/IP and
   a Modbus dataset shows that we can acquire network packets up to 100
   times faster than packet parsing based methods. However, we still
   achieve precision and recall metrics for longer lasting attacks of over
   99\%.}},

   an approach is proposed for the secure state estimation in

   a switch in the system behaviour. We consider only two system modes,
   nominal mode and attacked mode. As the switching sequence is unknown,
   information coming from IT cybersecurity layer is used to guide the
   switching signal of the observer mode. The residual signal provided by
   the switched observer also influences the switching signal of the
   observer. The stability of the resulting estimation error dynamics is
   proven. An example is given to illustrate the advantage of the proposed
   approach over two other switching observer schemes.}},

   access to the system. In this article, we proposed an attack detection
   mechanism for an insider who has physical access to a CPS. The proposed
   method exploits the dynamics of the system and detects an attack based
   on the laws of Physics. Based on the mass flow equations, we analyze the
   rate of change in the plant's process and create a feature vector based
   on the process dynamics. The model has been trained by passing rate of
   change in system's state as input to Support Vector Machine (SVM), to
   detect the abnormal behavior in the system. Based on the proposed
   framework, experiments are performed on a real water treatment testbed,
   to validate our model and to measure the efficiency of the plant in
   normal and under attack scenarios. The detection result shows that
   proposed scheme can detect attacks with accuracy as high as 96\%.}},

Abstract = {{False data injection (FDI) attacks are crucial security threats to smart
   grid cyber-physical system (CPS), and could result in cataclysmic
   consequences to the entire power system. However, due to the high
   dependence on open information networking, countering FDI attacks is
   challenging in smart grid CPS. Most existing solutions are based on
   state estimation (SE) at the highly centralized control center; thus,
   computationally expensive. In addition, these solutions generally do not
   provide a high level of security assurance, as evidenced by recent work
   that smart FDI attackers with knowledge of system configurations can
   easily circumvent conventional SE-based false data detection mechanisms.
   In this paper, in order to address these challenges, a novel distributed
   host-based collaborative detection method is proposed. Specifically, in
   our approach, we use a conjunctive rule based majority voting algorithm
   to collaboratively detect false measurement data inserted by compromised
   phas or measurement units (PMUs). In addition, an innovative reputation
   system with an adaptive reputation updating algorithm is also designed
   to evaluate the overall running status of PMUs, by which FDI attacks can
   be distinctly observed. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted
   with real-time measurement data obtained from the Power World simulator,
   and the numerical results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our
   proposal. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   representative model of the system is derived. A Kalman filter is used
   for the purpose of state estimation. By subtracting the state estimates
   from the real system states, a residual vector is obtained. It is shown
   that in steady state the residual vector is a function of process and
   sensor noise. A set of time domain and frequency domain features is
   extracted from the residual vector. Feature set is provided to a machine
   learning algorithm to identify the sensor and process. Experiments are
   performed on two testbeds, a real-world water treatment (SWaT) facility
   and a water distribution (WADI) testbed. A class of zero-alarm attacks,
   designed for statistical detectors on SWaT are detected by the proposed
   scheme. It is shown that a multitude of sensors can be uniquely
   identified with accuracy higher than 90\% based on the noise
   fingerprint.}},

Abstract = {{From electricity distribution to water management, higher levels of
   efficiency and performance have been attained by the synergy of
   computers, communications, and control. This higher level of
   performance, however, comes at a cost to system security. Cyber-Physical
   Systems (CPS) have intrinsic vulnerabilities that malicious agents can
   explore in order to harm the integrity of the system. An attacker
   employing deception-based methods seeks to have their target believe an
   incorrect version of reality. This paper describes two anomaly detection
   approaches using, respectively, micro-level and process-level techniques
   which are then combined into one cross-level hypothesis test. The
   process-level (also referred as macro-level) detector uses the physical
   interconnections that exist between the multiple sensors and implements
   a consensus algorithm to determine if one sensor is reporting anomalous
   values. The micro-level detector uses measurements of the integrated
   circuit power supply current draw sampling several times per clock cycle
   to determine if the code running inside the micro-controller of a sensor
   has been altered. One example of a sensor-based deception attack the
   present work focuses on is a simple replay attack launched from one
   sensor within the system that aims to mislead controllers while eluding
   conventional fault detectors. The theoretical performance of the
   proposed method is evaluated in two laboratory experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber physical systems (CPS) are process control systems interacting
   with the cyber world. Once connected to the internet, they become prone
   to attacks and attackers can easily modify the data by tampering the
   data while passing through the network. Attacks on CPS may not only have
   financial impacts but also can be a threat to human lives involved.
   Thus, security of Cyber Physical System is essential. This paper
   proposes a concept for enhancing security of the Cyber Physical System
   through an anomaly detection system using behaviour analysis. The
   proposed system uses Kalman Filter, knowledge base and comparator model.
   Kalman filter will be used to predict estimated states. Knowledge base
   will be first trained using simulated data of the system including
   faulty data. Once the filter is tested and knowledge base is trained,
   real time data will be passed through the prediction system and the
   predicted estimates will be compared with the data stored in knowledge
   base using comparator to detect anomalies. On detection of abnormal
   data, they will then be further identified as faults or attacks.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of detection and identification of the
   sensor attacks when most sensors are attacked. Sensors can play a key
   role to improve safety and convenience in automotive Cyber-Physical
   Systems (CPS). A dramatic increase in connectivity and openness of the
   automotive CPS brings high security risks. If multiple and heterogeneous
   sensors equipped for braking and steering provides false sensing
   information for their controllers under deception attacks, it might
   cause catastrophic situations during driving. If the existing machine
   learning approaches are applied for sensor attacks while the majority of
   sensors is attacked, it cannot guarantee to identify deceptions as
   cyber-physical attacks. To address this problem, we propose an
   intelligent sensor attack detection and identification method based on
   Deep Neural Network (DNN) techniques, called deep learning, without a
   prior knowledge about the deception attacks modifying sensing data in
   time. We investigate an autonomous vehicle with Inertial Measurement
   Unit (IMU) and wheel encoder sensors under conditions of uncertainty and
   nonlinearity during driving. We firstly identify all possible attacks
   category on the sensors of it, choose what model to use and then
   systematically design its architecture on which the performance of deep
   learning highly depends. We train and then validate the proposed
   method's performance on real measurement data obtained from an unmanned
   ground vehicle. Finally, we show analytically the superiority of our
   method in terms of accuracy, precision, and computation time, including
   the worst situation where two among three sensors are simultaneously
   attacked.}},

Abstract = {{Sequential data generated from various sources in a multi-mode
   industrial production system provides valuable information on the
   current mode of the system and enables one to build a model for each
   individual operating mode. Using these models in a multi-mode system,
   one may distinguish modes of the system and, furthermore, detect whether
   the current mode is a (normal or faulty) mode known from historical
   data, or a new mode. In this work, we model each individual mode by a
   probabilistic suffix tree (PST) used to implement variable order Markov
   models (VOMMs) and propose a novel unsupervised PST matching algorithm
   that compares the tree models by a matching cost once they are
   constructed. The matching cost we define comprises of a subsequence
   dissimilarity cost and a probability cost. Our tree matching method
   enables to compare two PSTs in linear time by one concurrent top-down
   pass. We use this matching cost as a similarity measure for k-medoid
   clustering and cluster PSTs obtained from system modes according to
   their matching costs. The overall approach yields promising results for
   unsupervised identification of modes on data obtained from of a physical
   factory demonstrator. Notably we can distinguish modes on two levels of
   granularity, both corresponding to human expert labels, with a RAND
   score of up to 73 \% compared to a baseline of at most 42 \%.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems are found in industrial and production systems,
   as well as critical infrastructures. Due to the increasing integration
   of IP-based technology and standard computing devices, the threat of
   cyber-attacks on cyber-physical systems has vastly increased.
   Furthermore, traditional intrusion defense strategies for IT systems are
   often not applicable in operational environments. In this paper we
   present an anomaly-based approach for detection and classification of
   attacks in cyber-physical systems. To test our approach, we set up a
   test environment with sensors, actuators and controllers widely used in
   industry, thus, providing system data as close as possible to reality.
   First, anomaly detection is used to define a model of normal system
   behavior by calculating outlier scores from normal system operations.
   This valid behavior model is then compared with new data in order to
   detect anomalies. Further, we trained an attack model, based on
   supervised attacks against the test setup, using the naive Bayes
   classifier. If an anomaly is detected, the classification process tries
   to classify the anomaly by applying the attack model and calculating
   prediction confidences for trained classes. To evaluate the statistical
   performance of our approach, we tested the model by applying an
   unlabeled dataset, which contains valid and anomalous data. The results
   show that this approach was able to detect and classify such attacks
   with satisfactory accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems - systems that incorporate physical devices with
   cyber components - are appearing in diverse applications, and due to
   advances in data acquisition, are accompanied with large amounts of
   data. The interplay between the cyber and the physical components leaves
   such systems vulnerable to faults and intrusions, motivating the
   development of a general model that can efficiently and continuously
   monitor a cyber-physical system. To be of practical value, the model
   should be adaptive and equipped with the ability to detect changes in
   the system. This paper makes three contributions: (1) a new adaptive
   modeling framework for monitoring an arbitrary cyber-physical system in
   real-time using a flexible statistical distribution called the
   normal-gamma; (2) a novel streaming validation procedure, demonstrated
   on data streams from a cyber-physical system at Los Alamos National
   Laboratory, to justify the use of the normal-gamma and our new adaptive
   modeling approach; and (3) a new online change detection algorithm
   demonstrated on synthetic normal-gamma data streams.}},

Abstract = {{Within the frame of the fourth industrial revolution, also known as
   Industry 4.0, industrial cyber-physical production systems (ICPS) have
   experienced a significant progress. To this end, Industry 4.0 has
   brought upon an improved, flexible, and cost-efficient system
   architecture that can sustain the development of innovative applications
   and services. Nonetheless, this technological advancement also exposed
   ICPS to significant cyber threats. This paper contributes to the
   development of a cross-layer anomaly detection system (ADS) for ICPS by
   defining a lightweight detection methodology that leverages
   Dempster-Shafer's ``Theory of Evidence{''} in order to: infer the
   system's state; fuse evidence from a wide range of monitored parameters;
   and deliver a comprehensive and scalable detection system. The proposed
   approach is validated in the context of a real natural gas
   transportation installation.}},

Abstract = {{Detecting anomalies of a cyber physical system (CPS), which is a complex
   system consisting of both physical and software parts, is important
   because a CPS often operates autonomously in an unpredictable
   environment. However, because of the ever-changing nature and lack of a
   precise model for a CPS, detecting anomalies is still a challenging
   task. To address this problem, we propose applying an outlier detection
   method to a CPS log. By using a log obtained from an actual aquarium
   management system, we evaluated the effectiveness of our proposed method
   by analyzing outliers that it detected. By investigating the outliers
   with the developer of the system, we confirmed that some outliers
   indicate actual faults in the system. For example, our method detected
   failures of mutual exclusion in the control system that were unknown to
   the developer. Our method also detected transient losses of
   functionalities and unexpected reboots. On the other hand, our method
   did not detect anomalies that were too many and similar. In addition,
   our method reported rare but unproblematic concurrent combinations of
   operations as anomalies. Thus, our approach is effective at finding
   anomalies, but there is still room for improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSes) are being widely deployed in
   security-critical scenarios such as smart homes and medical devices.
   Unfortunately, the connectedness of these systems and their relative
   lack of security measures makes them ripe targets for attacks.
   Specification-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been shown to
   be effective for securing CPSs. Unfortunately, deriving invariants for
   capturing the specifications of CPS systems is a tedious and error-prone
   process. Therefore, it is important to dynamically monitor the CPS
   system to learn its common behaviors and formulate invariants for
   detecting security attacks. Existing techniques for invariant mining
   only incorporate data and events, but not time. However, time is central
   to most CPS systems, and hence incorporating time in addition to data
   and events, is essential for achieving low false positives and false
   negatives.
   This paper proposes ARTINALI, which mines dynamic system properties by
   incorporating time as a first-class property of the system. We build
   ARTINALI-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes) for two CPSes, namely
   smart meters and smart medical devices, and measure their efficacy. We
   find that the ARTINALI-based IDSes significantly reduce the ratio of
   false positives and false negatives by 16 to 48\% (average 30.75\%) and
   89 to 95\% (average 93.4\%) respectively over other dynamic invariant
   detection tools.}},

Abstract = {{Smart grid infrastructure is an integration of advanced communication,
   sensing and computing techniques into the existing physical electrical
   grid. It is emerging as a critical cyber-physical system (CPS)
   infrastructure. CPS comes across as systems with a tight integration
   between the physical and the cyber layers in addition to the
   communication network. This exposes it to a risk of mis-operation when
   subjected to false or malicious data injection from intruders or
   adversaries. In order to address this issue, this paper proposes a data
   analytics based cyber defense strategy of a substation automation system
   (SAS) by developing an intelligent module which uses Support vector
   machine (SVM) along with Principal component analysis (PCA). We propose
   a two stage approach for detecting the false data injection by an
   intruder into the system. First stage reduces the high dimensional
   dataset to a lower dimension using PCA and the second stage uses SVM on
   the reduced dataset for detecting the malicious attempts of introducing
   false data into the system. The proposed module uses the measurement
   values received from the Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). Upon receiving
   a fault signal, the protection system initiates checks on incoming data
   patterns and compares it with the behavior of system dynamics. Using
   data analytics tools the fault condition signaling is classified as
   actual (real) fault or false (fake) fault with malicious intentions. The
   proposed methodology is demonstrated on three bus power network.}},

Abstract = {{In security standards, operation log of Cyber Physical System (CPS)
   should be periodically reviewed to uncover those attacks that were not
   detected by Industrial Intrusion Detection System (IIDS). In this
   review, security experts may find some attack samples; however this
   manual process is not practical considering the large number of samples
   in log. In addition, in sophisticated cyber-attacks such as Stuxnet
   worm, determining normal samples with high confidence can be
   complicated. Hence, a semi-supervised dataset with only some positive
   samples (attacks) is available. In this paper, a statistical method for
   detecting attacks in such datasets is proposed. To the best of our
   knowledge, this work is the first try on detecting attacks in semi
   supervised datasets in industrial settings. This method, which is called
   SADCPS, assumes that attack samples are significantly different from
   normal ones in several features. These features are identified by
   Welch's statistical t-test. Each discriminative feature decides whether
   a sample is attack or not. Then for each sample, weighted voting is
   performed on the results of discriminative features and attack index is
   calculated. Thus, security experts instead of searching all samples,
   only inspect samples with higher attack indexes. For evaluations, a milk
   pasteurization process with almost 50 I/Os (features) were simulated and
   its normal operation and operation under attack were logged for several
   periods. Results indicated that given only few attacks, SADCPS assigns
   most of the first ranks (higher attack indexes) to attack samples.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of jointly detecting and isolating
   cyber-physical attacks on Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition
   (SCADA) systems. The SCADA systems are described as a discrete-time
   state space model in the presence of unknown system states and Gaussian
   noises. The cyber-physical attacks are modeled as additive signals on
   both system equations, where different attack scenarios will produce
   particular changes (referred as attack profiles) in system dynamics. To
   solve the problem, we employ the classical approach in fault detection
   and isolation (FDI) community which includes two steps: residual
   generation and residual evaluation. The so-called residuals are first
   generated by the parity space method. They are then evaluated by using
   statistical change-point detection and isolation algorithms. The
   proposed algorithm is applied to the detection and isolation of several
   attack scenarios on a simple SCADA water distribution network. Its
   statistical performance is also compared with several conventional
   quickest change detection and isolation algorithms by using the
   transient change detection and isolation criterion. This novel-proposed
   criterion involves the minimization of the probability of missed
   detection subject to given values on the probability of false alarm and
   false isolation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with cyber-physical attack detection problem in
   networked control systems subject to limited communication bandwidth.
   This constraint arises when an attack detection system is located at a
   remote site and so the required signals, measurement output and control
   signals, need to be transmitted over a digital communication channel.
   Therefore, data before being sent to the remote site must be encoded and
   converted from analog signals to digital signals by using quantizer. A
   quantizer maps the amount of information from a continuous space to a
   finite set which is compatible with the limited communication bandwidth.
   Considering the quantized measurement output, a detection algorithm by
   means of a set-membership filtering approach will be proposed. The
   algorithm consists of a prediction ellipsoid set and an estimation
   ellipsoid set updated with the quantized measurement output. The
   detection method depends on the existence of intersection between two
   sets computed by the filter. Simulation results for some possible
   physical and cyber attacks are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness
   of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach for detecting replay attacks on cyber-physical systems is
   presented in this paper. The diagnosis system under a replay attack will
   not trigger an alarm as long as the received sensor readings are
   plausible. Since an adversary is not able to react on system changes due
   to the simplicity of the attack and a lack of system knowledge, our goal
   is to excite the system in non-regular time intervals. Subsequently we
   can check by means of signal processing whether the received sensor
   readings are valid. To excite harmonic oscillations, we insert a
   nonlinear element in the control loop and exploit the theory of
   describing functions. Since the nonlinear function is a design
   parameter, we are able to design robust harmonic oscillations. Another
   advantage of the proposed approach is the possibility of elegant
   implementation into existing control systems.}},

   sensors. In order to save the precious network resources, a novel
   distributed event-triggered strategy is proposed. Under this strategy,
   to generate the localized residual signals, the event-triggered
   distributed fault detection filters are proposed. By Lyapunov-Krasovskii
   functional theory, the distributed fault detection filtering problem can
   be formulated as stability and an H-infinity performance of the residual
   system. Furthermore, a sufficient condition is derived such that the
   resultant residual system is stable while the transmission of the
   sampled data is reduced. Based on this condition, the codesign method of
   the fault detection filters and the transmission strategy is proposed.

   strategies are very sophisticated and rely on perfect system knowledge.
   The resulting attack signal is completely invisible in the sensor

   such attacks and to trigger an alarm. Our goal is to insert a modulation
   matrix in the path of the control variables. By altering the input
   behavior of the process, the adversary will lose his perfect system
   knowledge and therefore his attacks can be revealed. We design the
   modulation matrix by focusing on covert attacks. By guaranteeing that
   the modulation changes the input directions, we unmask zero dynamics
   attacks as well, since multivariable zeros depend on frequency and

Abstract = {{Modern distributed cyber-physical systems (CPSs) encounter a large
   variety of physical faults and cyber anomalies and in many cases, they

   data-driven framework for system-wide anomaly detection for addressing
   such issues. The framework is based on a spatiotemporal feature
   extraction scheme built on the concept of symbolic dynamics for
   discovering and representing causal interactions among the subsystems of
   a CPS. The extracted spatiotemporal features are then used to learn
   system-wide patterns via a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). The
   results show that: (1) the RBM free energy in the off-nominal conditions
   is different from that in the nominal conditions and can be used for
   anomaly detection; (2) the framework can capture multiple nominal modes
   with one graphical model; (3) the case studies with simulated data and
   an integrated building system validate the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Additive Manufacturing (AM) uses Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) (e.g., 3D
   Printers) that are vulnerable to kinetic cyber-attacks. Kinetic
   cyber-attacks cause physical damage to the system from the cyber domain.
   In AM, kinetic cyber-attacks are realized by introducing flaws in the
   design of the 3D objects. These flaws may eventually compromise the
   structural integrity of the printed objects. In CPS, researchers have
   designed various attack detection method to detect the attacks on the
   integrity of the system. However, in AM, attack detection method is in
   its infancy. Moreover, analog emissions (such as acoustics,
   electromagnetic emissions, etc.) from the side-channels of AM have not
   been fully considered as a parameter for attack detection. To aid the
   security research in AM, this paper presents a novel attack detection
   method that is able to detect zero-day kinetic cyber-attacks on AM by
   identifying anomalous analog emissions which arise as an outcome of the
   attack. This is achieved by statistically estimating functions that map
   the relation between the analog emissions and the corresponding cyber
   domain data (such as G-code) to model the behavior of the system. Our
   method has been tested to detect potential zero-day kinetic
   cyber-attacks in fused deposition modeling based AM. These attacks can
   physically manifest to change various parameters of the 3D object, such
   as speed, dimension, and movement axis. Accuracy, defined as the
   capability of our method to detect the range of variations introduced to
   these parameters as a result of kinetic cyber-attacks, is 77.45\%.}},

Abstract = {{Anomalies in cyber-physical systems may arise due to malicious cyber
   attacks or operational faults in the physical devices. Accurately
   detecting the anomalies and isolating their root-causes is important for
   identifying appropriate reactive and preventive measures and building
   resilient cyber-physical systems. Anomaly detection and isolation in
   cyber-physical systems is challenging, because the impact of a cyber
   attack on the operation of a physical system may manifest itself only
   after some time. In this paper, we present a Bayesian network approach
   for learning the causal relations between cyber and physical variables
   as well as their temporal correlations from unlabeled data. We describe
   the data transformations that we performed to deal with the
   heterogeneous characteristics of the cyber and physical data, so that
   the integrated dataset can be used to learn the Bayesian network
   structure and parameters. We then present scalable algorithms to detect
   different anomalies and isolate their respective root-cause using a
   Bayesian network. We also present results from evaluating our algorithms
   on an unlabeled dataset consisting of anomalies due to cyber attacks and
   physical faults in a commercial building system.}},

Abstract = {{As the complexity of cyber-physical systems increases, so does the
   number of ways an adversary can disrupt them. This necessitates
   automated anomaly detection methods to detect possible threats. In this
   paper, we extend our recent results in the field of inference via formal
   methods to develop an unsupervised learning algorithm. Our procedure
   constructs from data a signal temporal logic (STL) formula that
   describes normal system behavior. Trajectories that do not satisfy the
   learned formula are flagged as anomalous. STL can be used to formulate
   properties such as ``If the train brakes within 500 m of the platform at
   a speed of 50 km/hr, then it will stop in at least 30 s and at most 50
   s.{''} STL gives a more human-readable representation of behavior than
   classifiers represented as surfaces in high-dimensional feature spaces.
   STL formulae can also be used for early detection via online monitoring
   and for anomaly mitigation via formal synthesis. We demonstrate the
   power of our method with a physical model of a train's brake system. To
   our knowledge, this paper is the first instance of formal methods being
   applied to anomaly detection.}},

Abstract = {{This article consists of two parts: a theoretical part concerned with
   fault detection schemes, and an application part dealing with cyber
   security of power systems. In the first part, we develop a tractable
   approach to design a robust residual generator to detect and isolate
   faults in high dimensional nonlinear systems. Previous approaches on
   fault detection and isolation problems are either confined to linear
   systems or they are only applicable to low dimensional dynamics with
   more specific structures. In contrast, we propose a novel methodology to
   robustify a linear residual generator for a nonlinear system in the
   presence of certain disturbance signatures. To this end, we formulate
   the problem into the framework of quadratic programming which enables us
   to solve relatively high dimensional systems. In the second part, the
   application is motivated by the emerging problem of cyber security in
   power networks. We provide description of a multi-machine power system
   that represents a two-area power system, and we model a cyber-physical
   attack emanating from the vulnerabilities introduced by the interaction
   between IT infrastructure and power system. The algorithm developed in
   the first part is finally used to diagnose such an intrusion before the
   functionality of the power system is disrupted.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose an anomaly intrusion detection model based on
   shuffle operation and product machines targeting persistent
   interposition attacks on control systems. These attacks actually are
   undetectable by the most advanced system call monitors as they issue no
   system calls and are stealthy enough to transfer control to hijacked
   library functions without letting their saved instruction Pointers get
   stored on stack. We exploit the fact that implementations of control
   protocols running in control systems, which in turn are attached to
   physical systems such as power plants and electrical substations,
   exhibit strong regularities in terms of sequences of function calls and
   system calls issued during protocol transactions. The main idea behind
   the proposed approach is to introduce NULL function calls within a
   Modbus binary and to apply the shuffle operation between them and
   existing function calls. We then devise and implement a product machine
   capable of recognizing the shuffle representation of function call and
   system call regularities. A sensor uses a unidirectional interprocess
   communication channel based on shared memory to receive profile data
   from a Modbus process, and subsequently submits them to the product
   machine. We describe an experimental evaluation of our model on an
   ARM-based Modbus device and demonstrate that the proposed model
   overcomes the limitations of state of the art approaches with regard to
   detection of persistent interposition attacks on control systems.}},

Abstract = {{To improve productivity and efficiency in industrial manufacturing, the
   fourth industrial revolution leads to the implementation of Cyber
   Physical Systems (CPS) and Internet of Things (IoT) in the industrial

   prone to various attacks and malicious threats by different adversaries.
   The impact of an attack on the system can lead to anomalies and serious
   consequences for system parts or the system as a whole. Security
   mechanisms must be developed in order to timely detect different attacks
   and to keep the system safe and protected. In this paper, a method for
   sensor signal attacks detection in a continuous time controlled systems

   CNN and GRU}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{88348-88359}},
Abstract = {{Currently, most anomaly detection approaches in industrial control
   systems (ICSs) use network event logs to build models, and current
   unsupervised machine learning methods rarely use spatiotemporal
   correlations and other dependencies between multiple variables
   (sensors/actuators) in a system to detect anomalies. Most of the
   existing anomaly detection technologies simply compare the current
   states with the predicted normal range. Due to the highly dynamic
   characteristic of industrial control systems, it is insufficient to
   simply compare the current states with the predicted normal range. As a
   result, these approaches have low detection rates for unknown or new
   types of attacks. In view of these shortcomings, this paper presents a
   network model for predicting sensor/controller parameters in industrial
   control systems. To predict the parameter values of the sensors and
   controllers more accurately, the 1D convolutional neural network (1D \&
   x005F;CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) are combined to fully learn
   the spatiotemporal correlation and other dependencies between the
   parameter values of the sensors and controllers at each moment. An
   abnormal state detection method based on the calculation of the
   statistical deviation is proposed to realize the anomaly detection of
   industrial control systems. The model is validated on the Secure Water
   Treatment (SWaT) dataset. The precision, recall and F1 scores are used
   to evaluate the effectiveness of this method in anomaly detection on the
   SWaT dataset. The experimental results show that the average precision
   and recall of this method are 0.99 and 0.85, respectively, and that the
   average F1 score is 0.91. The experimental results show that the
   proposed method can be successfully applied to anomaly detection systems
   in industrial control systems with lower false positive rates.}},

Abstract = {{The growing number of attacks against cyberphysical systems in recent
   years elevates the concern for cybersecurity of industrial control
   systems (ICSs). The current efforts of ICS cybersecurity are mainly
   based on firewalls, data diodes, and other methods of intrusion
   prevention, which may not be sufficient for growing cyber threats from
   motivated attackers. To enhance the cybersecurity of ICS, a cyber-attack
   detection system built on the concept of defense-in-depth is developed
   utilizing network traffic data, host system data, and measured process
   parameters. This attack detection system provides multiple-layer defense
   in order to gain the defenders precious time before unrecoverable
   consequences occur in the physical system. The data used for
   demonstrating the proposed detection system are from a real-time ICS
   testbed. Five attacks, including man in the middle (MITM), denial of
   service (DoS), data exfiltration, data tampering, and false data
   injection, are carried out to simulate the consequences of cyber attack
   and generate data for building data-driven detection models. Four
   classical classification models based on network data and host system
   data are studied, including k-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree,
   bootstrap aggregating (bagging), and random forest (RF), to provide a
   secondary line of defense of cyber-attack detection in the event that
   the intrusion prevention layer fails. Intrusion detection results
   suggest that KNN, bagging, and RF have low missed alarm and false alarm
   rates for MITM and DoS attacks, providing accurate and reliable
   detection of these cyber attacks. Cyber attacks that may not be
   detectable by monitoring network and host system data, such as command
   tampering and false data injection attacks by an insider, are monitored
   for by traditional process monitoring protocols. In the proposed
   detection system, an auto-associative kernel regression model is studied
   to strengthen early attack detection. The result shows that this
   approach detects physically impactful cyber attacks before significant
   consequences occur. The proposed multiple-layer data-driven cyber-attack
   detection system utilizing network, system, and process data is a
   promising solution for safeguarding an ICS.}},

   independently using the normalized raw data and a pre-processed version
   of the data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), respectively, to
   detect attacks by separating-away anomalies. The performance of the

Abstract = {{The increasing interaction of modern industrial control systems (ICS) to
   the outside Internet world influences making these systems vulnerable to
   a wide range of cyber-attacks. Moreover, the utilisation of
   Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) products, as well as open communication
   protocols, made them attractive targets to various threat agents
   including cyber-criminals, national-state, and cyber-terrorists. Given
   that, today's ICSs are deriving the most critical national
   infrastructures. Therefore, this raises tremendous needs to secure these
   systems against cyber-attacks. Intrusion detection technology has been
   considered as one of the most essential security precautions for ICS
   networks. It can effectively detect potential cyber-attacks and

   Systems (ICS) using digital signal processing (DSP) technology. By
   processing signals from sensors using a comb of digital low-pass filters
   (LPF), additional informative features, that describe the control

Abstract = {{Modern Industrial Control Systems (ICS) constitute complex and
   heterogeneous `system of systems' embracing the numerous advantages of
   traditional Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The
   pervasive integration of off-the-shelf ICT into the core of ICS
   broadened the palette of features and applications, but it also raised
   new design challenges and exposed ICS to a new breed of cyber-physical
   attacks. In addition, despite all the security solutions in place,
   unavoidably, these systems may be compromised. Therefore, survivability,
   that is, the ability to face malicious actions and faults, becomes a
   salient feature/requirement in the design of modern cyber-connected ICS.
   We present a comprehensive solution for ensuring the survival of ICS
   under malicious activities and faults. We design a Software Defined
   Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) based
   communication infrastructure particularly tailored to address the
   communication requirements of ICS. We develop an attack detection and
   localization algorithm for bidirectional ICS flows, and we design an
   optimal intervention strategy that embraces the communication and
   security requirements of industrial applications. Finally, we present
   intrinsic details on recreating a real-life and emulated test
   infrastructure. Experimental results demonstrate the solution's
   applicability to networked robot control systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Industrial process anomaly detection mechanisms have been proposed to
   protect industrial control system to minimize the risk of damage or loss
   of resources. In this paper, an one-class Support Vector Machine based
   extended boundary (EB-OSCVM) is used to detect anomalies in industrial
   multivariate time series data from a simulated Tennessee Eastman Process
   (TEP) with many cyber attacks. In detail, determine the change points of
   each process variable and capture the causality relationship between the
   variables based on the location and time delay of the change points.
   Then, by monitoring the leaf nodes in the causality graph, we can know
   whether the system is abnormal, it can effectively reduce the dimension
   of process data. The EB-OSCVM extend classification boundary of OCSVM in
   order to reduce the error of noise, if data is outside the boundary of
   EB-OCSVM, there is an anomaly. Finally, tracing the anomaly source
   according to causal direction. An experiment is used to verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed approach, the results demonstrate that the
   approach presents a high-accuracy solution and traces the source of
   anomaly correctly.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial control systems (ICS) are vital for countries' industrial
   facilities and critical infrastructures. However, there are not enough
   security assessments against cyber attacks carried out on ICS for not
   preventing business continuity. New attacks are being made every day
   against these systems. Threats and attacks against critical
   infrastructures must be detected for protecting human life and assets.
   For this reason, detection has become more important than the prevention
   of attacks. In this study, vulnerability and attack detection analysis
   was carried out on programmable logic controllers (PLCs), one of the
   most important components of ICS, in the testbed and a rule set was
   created to detect active start/stop attacks. In this case, with writing
   this rule table, similar attacks will be prevented without harming the
   critical systems. In the analysis, mirroring technique was used to
   prevent the detection system from imposing additional load to the
   existing system and affecting the operation of the system negatively. In
   the test environment, Siemens S-7 1200 (Firmware 2.2) PLC devices were
   used. Smoothsec system, which is not used in industrial systems, is used
   for detection and rule table. It is assessed that this novel approach
   will provide significant contributions to attract attention to
   vulnerabilities and the security analysis of industrial control systems.

Abstract = {{Due its complexity and a multitude of proprietary components, industrial
   control systems are an immanently difficult field of application for
   intrusion detection. Proprietary binary protocols and the lack of public
   specifications have forced the research community to move away from
   content-based detection to more abstract concepts. In this paper, we
   show that in contrast to prior belief the content of unknown binary
   protocols can very well be modeled. ZOE derives prototype models that
   are specific to individual types of messages in order to capture the
   characteristics of arbitrary binary protocols and enable detecting
   different forms of attacks as anomalies. In an evaluation based on 6
   days of network traffic recorded at a large power plant (1,900 MW) with
   over 92,000 unique devices, we demonstrate that ZOE improves upon
   related approaches by up to an order of magnitude in detection
   performance, but also significantly decreases false positives.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& SECURITY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{103-125}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Industrial control systems (ICS) are moving from dedicated
   communications to switched and routed corporate networks, exposing them
   to the Internet and placing them at risk of cyber-attacks. Existing
   methods of detecting cyber-attacks, such as intrusion detection systems
   (IDSs), are commonly implemented in ICS and SCADA networks. However,
   these devices do not detect more complex threats that manifest
   themselves gradually over a period of time through a combination of
   unusual sequencing of activities, such as process-related attacks.
   During the normal operation of ICSs, ICS devices record device logs,
   capturing their industrial processes over time. These logs are a rich
   source of information that should be analysed in order to detect such
   process-related attacks.
   In this paper, we present a novel process mining anomaly detection
   method for identifying anomalous behaviour and cyber-attacks using ICS
   data logs and the conformance checking analysis technique from the
   process mining discipline. A conformance checking analysis uses logs
   captured from production systems with a process model (which captures
   the expected behaviours of a system) to determine the extent to which
   real behaviours (captured in the logs) matches the expected behaviours
   (captured in the process model). The contributions of this paper include
   an experimentally derived recommendation for logging practices on ICS
   devices, for the purpose of process mining-based analysis; a formalised
   approach for pre-processing and transforming device logs from ICS
   systems into event logs suitable for process mining analysis; guidance
   on how to create a process model for ICSs and how to apply the created
   process model through a conformance checking analysis to identify
   anomalous behaviours. Our anomaly detection method has been successfully
   applied in detecting ICS cyber-attacks, which the widely used IDS Snort
   does not detect, using logs derived from industry standard ICS devices.

Abstract = {{Anomaly detection for industrial control systems (ICS) can leverage
   process data to detect malicious derivations from expected process
   behavior. We propose state-aware anomaly detection that uses state
   dependent detection thresholds, which provide tighter constraints for an
   attacker trying to manipulate the process. In particular, our system
   provides: (i) estimation of system state from the knowledge of the
   network and the physical process (ii) a state-aware cumulative sum of
   residuals for monitoring the industrial control system (iii) and a novel
   state-aware anomaly detection technique. We implement and evaluate our
   anomaly detection technique on a real-world ICS. We pre-compute the
   process-state parameters using a big data framework for ICS and train
   the detector leveraging more than 120 GB of historical data from the
   ICS. The results show that the proposed method improves prior works by
   providing less time-to-detect of attacks while generating fewer false

Abstract = {{Industrial control systems are the fundamental infrastructures of a
   country. Since the intrusion attack methods for industrial control
   systems have become complex and concealed, the traditional protection
   methods, such as vulnerability database, virus database and rule
   matching cannot cope with the attacks hidden inside the terminals of
   industrial control systems. In this work, we propose a control flow
   anomaly detection algorithm based on the control flow of the business
   programs. First, a basic group partition method based on key paths is
   proposed to reduce the performance burden caused by tabbed-assert
   control flow analysis method through expanding basic research units.
   Second, the algorithm phases of standard path set acquisition and path
   matching are introduced. By judging whether the current control flow
   path is deviating from the standard set or not, the abnormal operating
   conditions of industrial control can be detected. Finally, the
   effectiveness of a control flow anomaly detection (checking) algorithm
   based on Path Matching (CFCPM) is demonstrated by anomaly detection
   ability analysis and experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial Control Systems (ICS) such as water and power are critical to
   any society. Process anomaly detection mechanisms have been proposed to
   protect such systems to minimize the risk of damage or loss of
   resources. In this paper, a graphical model-based approach is proposed
   for profiling normal operational behavior of an operational ICS referred
   to as SWaT (Secure Water Treatment). Timed automata are learned as a
   model of regular behaviors shown in sensors signal like fluctuations of
   water level in tanks. Bayesian networks are learned to discover
   dependencies between sensors and actuators. The models are used as a
   one-class classifier for process anomaly detection, recognizing
   irregular behavioral patterns and dependencies. The detection results
   can be interpreted and the abnormal sensors or actuators localized due
   to the interpretability of the graphical models. This approach is
   applied to a dataset collected from SWaT. Experimental results
   demonstrate the model's superior performance on both precision and
   run-time over methods including support vector machine and deep neural
   networks. The underlying idea is generic and applicable to other
   industrial control systems such as power and transportation.}},

Abstract = {{Most existing industrial control systems (ICSs), such as building energy
   management systems (EMSs), were installed when potential security
   threats were only physical. With advances in connectivity, ICSs are now,
   typically, connected to communications networks and, as a result, can be
   accessed remotely. This extends the attack surface to include the
   potential for sophisticated cyber attacks, which can adversely impact
   ICS operation, resulting in service interruption, equipment damage,
   safety concerns, and associated financial implications. In this work, a
   novel cyber-physical security framework for ICSs is proposed, which
   incorporates an analytics tool for attack detection and executes a
   reliable estimation-based attack-resilient control policy, whenever an
   attack is detected. The proposed framework is adaptable to already
   implemented ICS and the stability and optimal performance of the
   controlled system under attack has been proved. The performance of the
   proposed framework is evaluated using a reduced order model of a real
   EMS site and simulated attacks.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) are moving from dedicated
   communications to Ethernet-based interconnected networks, placing them
   at risk of cyber attack. ICS networks are typically monitored by an
   Intrusion Detection System (IDS), however traditional IDSs do not detect
   attacks which disrupt the control flow of an ICS. ICSs are unique in the
   repetition and restricted number of tasks that are undertaken. Thus
   there is the opportunity to use Process Mining, a series of techniques
   focused on discovering, monitoring and improving business processes, to
   detect ICS control flow anomalies. In this paper we investigate the
   suitability of various process mining discovery algorithms for the task
   of detecting cyber attacks on ICSs by examining logs from control
   devices. Firstly, we identify the requirements of this unique
   environment, and then evaluate the appropriateness of several commonly
   used process discovery algorithms to satisfy these requirements.
   Secondly, the comparison was performed and validated using ICS logs
   derived from a case study, containing successful attacks on industrial
   control systems. Our research shows that the Inductive Miner process
   discovery method, without the use of noise filtering, is the most
   suitable for discovering a process model that is effective in detecting
   cyber-attacks on industrial control systems, both in time spent and
   accuracy.}},

   The effective and reliable ICS cyber defense is a significant challenge

   the demanding tasks for the cyber security researchers. In this article,
   we examine classification problem. The proposed detection system is
   based on supervised anomaly detection techniques. Moreover, we utilized

Abstract = {{Industrial control systems (ICS) used in industrial plants are
   vulnerable to cyber-attacks that can cause fatal damage to the plants.
   Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) monitor ICS network traffic and
   detect suspicious activities. However, many IDSs overlook sophisticated
   cyber-attacks because it is hard to make a complete database of
   cyber-attacks and distinguish operational anomalies when compared to an
   established baseline. In this paper, a discriminant model between normal
   and anomalous packets was constructed with a support vector machine
   (SVM) based on an ICS communication profile, which represents only
   packet intervals and length, and an IDS with the applied model is
   proposed. Furthermore, the proposed IDS was evaluated using penetration
   tests on our cyber security test bed. Although the IDS was constructed
   by the limited features (intervals and length) of packets, the IDS
   successfully detected cyber-attacks by monitoring the rate of predicted
   attacking packets.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are found in critical infrastructure
   such as for power generation and water treatment. When security
   requirements are incorporated into an ICS, one needs to test the
   additional code and devices added do improve the prevention and
   detection of cyber attacks. Conducting such tests in legacy systems is a
   challenge due to the high availability requirement. An approach using
   Timed Automata (TA) is proposed to overcome this challenge. This
   approach enables assessment of the effectiveness of an attack detection
   method based on process invariants. The approach has been demonstrated
   in a case study on one stage of a 6stage operational water treatment
   plant. The model constructed captured the interactions among components
   in the selected stage. In addition, a set of attacks, attack detection
   mechanisms, and security specifications were also modeled using TA.
   These TA models were conjoined into a network and implemented in UPPAAL.
   The models so implemented were found effective in detecting the attacks
   considered. The study suggests the use of TA as an effective tool to
   model an ICS and study its attack detection mechanisms as a complement
   to doing so in a real plant-operational or under design.}},

Abstract = {{Developments and upgrades in the field of industrial information
   technology, particularly those relating to information systems'
   technologies for the collection and processing of real-time data, have
   introduced a large number of new threats. These threats are primarily
   related to the specific tasks these applications perform, such as their
   distinct design specifications, the specialized communication protocols
   they use and the heterogeneous devices they are required to
   interconnect. In particular, specialized attacks can undertake
   mechanical control, dynamic rearrangement of centrifugation or
   reprogramming of devices in order to accelerate or slow down their
   operations. This may result in total industrial equipment being
   destroyed or permanently damaged. Cyber-attacks against Industrial
   Control Systems which mainly use Supervisory Control and Data
   Acquisition (SCADA) combined with Distributed Control Systems are
   implemented with Programmable Logic Controllers. They are characterized
   as Advanced Persistent Threats. This paper presents an advanced Spiking
   One-Class Anomaly Detection Framework (SOCCADF) based on the evolving
   Spiking Neural Network algorithm. This algorithm implements an
   innovative application of the One-class classification methodology since
   it is trained exclusively with data that characterize the normal
   operation of ICS and it is able to detect divergent behaviors and
   abnormalities associated with APT attacks.}},

Abstract = {{The critical infrastructure, which includes the electric power grid,
   railroads and water treatment facilities, is dependent on the proper
   operation of industrial control systems. However, malware such as
   Stuxnet has demonstrated the ability to alter industrial control system
   parameters to create physical effects. Of particular concern is malware
   that targets embedded devices that monitor and control system
   functionality, while masking the actions from plant operators and
   security analysts. Indeed, system security relies on guarantees that the
   assurance of these devices can be maintained throughout their lifetimes.
   This paper presents a novel approach that uses timing-based side channel
   analysis to establish a unique device fingerprint that helps detect
   unauthorized modifications of the device. The approach is applied to an
   Allen Bradley ControlLogix programmable logic controller where execution
   time measurements are collected and analyzed by a custom anomaly
   detection system to detect abnormal behavior. The anomaly detection
   system achieves true positive rates of 0.978-1.000 with false positive
   rates of 0.033-0.044. The test results demonstrate the feasibility of
   using timing-based side channel analysis to detect anomalous behavior in
   programmable logic controllers. Published'by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic of Industrial Control System (ICS) between the Human Machine
   Interface (HMI) and the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is known to
   be highly periodic. However, it is sometimes multiplexed, due to
   asynchronous scheduling. Modeling the network traffic patterns of
   multiplexed ICS streams using Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) for
   anomaly detection typically produces a very large DFA and a high
   false-alarm rate. In this article, we introduce a new modeling approach
   that addresses this gap. Our Statechart DFA modeling includes multiple
   DFAs, one per cyclic pattern, together with a DFA-selector that
   de-multiplexes the incoming traffic into sub-channels and sends them to
   their respective DFAs. We demonstrate how to automatically construct the
   statechart from a captured traffic stream. Our unsupervised learning
   algorithms first build a Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from the
   stream. Next, we split the symbols into sets, one per multiplexed cycle,
   based on symbol frequencies and node degrees in the DTMC graph. Then, we
   create a sub-graph for each cycle and extract Euler cycles for each
   sub-graph. The final statechart is comprised of one DFA per Euler cycle.
   The algorithms allow for non-unique symbols, which appear in more than
   one cycle, and also for symbols that appear more than once in a cycle.
   We evaluated our solution on traces from a production ICS using the
   Siemens S7-0x72 protocol. We also stress-tested our algorithms on a
   collection of synthetically-generated traces that simulated multiplexed
   ICS traces with varying levels of symbol uniqueness and time overlap.
   The algorithms were able to split the symbols into sets with 99.6\%
   accuracy. The resulting statechart modeled the traces with a median
   false-alarm rate of as low as 0.483\%. In all but the most extreme
   scenarios, the Statechart model drastically reduced both the false-alarm
   rate and the learned model size in comparison with the naive single-DFA
   model.}},

Abstract = {{We outline an anomaly detection method for industrial control systems
   (ICS) that combines the analysis of network package contents that are
   transacted between ICS nodes and their time-series structure.
   Specifically, we take advantage of the predictable and regular nature of
   communication patterns that exist between so-called field devices in ICS
   networks. By observing a system for a period of time without the
   presence of anomalies we develop a base-line signature database for
   general packages. A Bloom filter is used to store the signature database
   which is then used for package content level anomaly detection.
   Furthermore, we approach time-series anomaly detection by proposing a
   stacked Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network-based softmax classifier
   which learns to predict the most likely package signatures that are
   likely to occur given previously seen package traffic. Finally, by the
   inspection of a real dataset created from a gas pipeline SCADA system,
   we show that an anomaly detection scheme combining both approaches can
   achieve higher performance compared to various current state-of-the-art
   techniques.}},

   industrial control software as the taint source file of taint analysis
   and the sample file of fuzzing. First, find key data which is most
   likely to have potential safety hazard in the configuration file through

Abstract = {{Modern Networked Critical Infrastructures (NCI), involving cyber and
   physical systems, are exposed to intelligent cyber attacks targeting the
   stable operation of these systems. In order to ensure anomaly awareness,
   the observed data can be used in accordance with data mining techniques
   to develop Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) or Anomaly Detection
   Systems (ADS). There is an increase in the volume of sensor data
   generated by both cyber and physical sensors, so there is a need to
   apply Big Data technologies for real-time analysis of large data sets.
   In this paper, we propose a clustering based approach for detecting
   cyber attacks that cause anomalies in NCI. Various clustering techniques
   are explored to choose the most suitable for clustering the time-series
   data features, thus classifying the states and potential cyber attacks
   to the physical system. The Hadoop implementation of MapReduce paradigm
   is used to provide a suitable processing environment for large datasets.

Abstract = {{The nature of the traffic in industrial control system network is
   markedly different from more open networks. Industrial control system
   networks should be far more restricted in what types of traffic
   diversity is present. This enables the usage of approaches that are
   currently not as feasible in open environments, such as machine learning
   based anomaly detection.
   Without proper customization for the special requirements of industrial
   control system network environment many existing anomaly or misuse
   detection systems will perform sub-optimally. Machine learning based
   approach would reduce the amount of manual customization required for
   different restricted network environments of which an industrial control
   system network is an good example of.
   In this paper we present an initial analysis of data received from a
   ethernet network of a live running industrial site. This includes both
   control data and the data flowing between the control network and the
   office network. A set of possible features to be used for detecting
   anomalies is studied for this environment.}},

   performance and commercial needs. The combination of Internet
   connections to systems with little if any security features and the fact
   that security by obscurity is not working anymore, has moved the topic
   of SCADA security into the forefront in the last few years. To address
   these challenges, in this paper we propose cyber-attack detection
   techniques based on temporal pattern recognition. Temporal pattern
   recognition methods do not only look for anomalies in the data
   transferred by the SCADA components over the network but also look for
   anomalies that can occur by misusing legitimate commands such that
   unauthorized and incorrect time intervals between them may cripple the
   system. Specifically, we propose two algorithms based on Hidden Markov
   Models (HMM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). We evaluate the
   algorithms on real and simulated SCADA data with five different feature
   extraction methods; in each method, the algorithms consider different
   aspects of the raw data. The results show that temporal pattern
   recognition methods, especially those based on time feature extraction,
   can detect cyber-attacks, including those that involve legitimate
   functions, which are known in the literature as hard to detect. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems operate
   critical infrastructures in our modern society despite their
   vulnerability to attacks and misuse. There are several anomaly detection
   systems based on the cycles of polling mechanisms used in SCADA systems,
   but the feasibility of anomaly detection systems based on non-polling
   traffic, so called spontaneous events, is not well-studied. This paper
   presents a novel approach to modeling the timing characteristics of
   spontaneous events in an IEC-60870-5-104 network and exploits the model
   for anomaly detection. The system is tested with a dataset from a real
   power utility with injected timing effects from two attack scenarios.
   One attack causes timing anomalies due to persistent malfunctioning in
   the field devices, and the other generates intermittent anomalies caused
   by malware on the field devices, which is considered as stealthy. The
   detection accuracy and timing performance are promising for all the
   experiments with persistent anomalies. With intermittent anomalies, we
   found that our approach is effective for anomalies in low-volume traffic
   or attacks lasting over 1 hour.}},

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems play a critical
   role in the operation of large-scale distributed industrial systems.
   There are many vulnerabilities in SCADA systems and inadvertent events
   or malicious attacks from outside as well as inside could lead to
   catastrophic consequences. Network-based intrusion detection is a
   preferred approach to provide security analysis for SCADA systems due to
   its less intrusive nature. Data in SCADA network traffic can be
   generally divided into transport, operation, and content levels. Most
   existing solutions only focus on monitoring and event detection of one
   or two levels of data, which is not enough to detect and reason about
   attacks in all three levels. In this paper, we develop a novel
   edge-based multi-level anomaly detection framework for SCADA networks
   named EDMAND. EDMAND monitors all three levels of network traffic data
   and applies appropriate anomaly detection methods based on the distinct
   characteristics of data. Alerts are generated, aggregated, prioritized
   before sent back to control centers. A prototype of the framework is
   built to evaluate the detection ability and time overhead of it.}},

Abstract = {{Critical Infrastructures (CIs) use Supervisory Control And Data
   Acquisition (SCADA) systems for remote control and monitoring.
   Sophisticated security measures are needed to address malicious
   intrusions, which are steadily increasing in number and variety due to
   the massive spread of connectivity and standardisation of open SCADA
   protocols. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) cannot detect
   attacks that are not already present in their databases. Therefore, in
   this paper, we assess Machine Learning (ML) for intrusion detection in
   SCADA systems using a real data set collected from a gas pipeline system
   and provided by the Mississippi State University (MSU). The contribution
   of this paper is two-fold: 1) The evaluation of four techniques for
   missing data estimation and two techniques for data normalization, 2)
   The performances of Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF)
   are assessed in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F-1 score for
   intrusion detection. Two cases are differentiated: binary and
   categorical classifications. Our experiments reveal that RF detect
   intrusions effectively, with an F-1 score of respectively > 99\%.}},

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems became vital
   targets for intruders because of the large volume of its sensitive data.
   The Cyber Physical Power Systems (CPPS) is an example of these systems
   in which the deregulation and multipoint communication between consumers
   and utilities involve large volume of high speed heterogeneous data. The
   Non-Nested Generalized Exemplars (NNGE) algorithm is one of the most
   accurate classification techniques that can work with such data of CPPS.
   However, NNGE algorithm tends to produce rules that test a large number
   of input features. This poses some problems for the large volume data
   and hinders the scalability of any detection system. In this paper, we
   introduce our new Feature Selection and Data Reduction Method (FSDRM) to
   improve the classification accuracy and speed of the NNGE algorithm and
   to reduce the computational resource consumption. FSDRM provides the
   following functionalities: (1) it reduces the dataset features by
   selecting the most significant ones, (2) it reduces the NNGE's
   hyperrectangles classifiers. The experiments show that the FSDRM reduces
   the NNGE hyperrectangles by 29.06\%, 37.34\%, and 26.76\% and improves
   the classification accuracy of the NNGE by 8.57\%, 4.19\%, and 3.78\%
   using the Multi, Binary, and Triple class datasets respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Attacks on critical infrastructures' Supervisory Control and Data
   Acquisition (SCADA) systems are beginning to increase. They are often
   initiated by highly skilled attackers, who are capable of deploying
   sophisticated attacks to exfiltrate data or even to cause physical
   damage. In this paper, we rehearse the rationale for protecting against
   cyber attacks and evaluate a set of Anomaly Detection (AD) techniques in
   detecting attacks by analysing traffic captured in a SCADA network. For
   this purpose, we have implemented a tool chain with a reference
   implementation of various state-of-the-art AD techniques to detect
   attacks, which manifest themselves as anomalies. Specifically, in order
   to evaluate the AD techniques, we apply our tool chain on a dataset
   created from a gas pipeline SCADA system in Mississippi State
   University's lab, which include artefacts of both normal operations and
   cyber attack scenarios. Our evaluation elaborate on several performance
   metrics of the examined AD techniques such as precision; recall;
   accuracy; F-score and G-score. The results indicate that detection rate
   may change significantly when considering various attack types and
   different detections modes (i.e., supervised and unsupervised), and also
   provide indications that there is a need for a robust, and preferably
   real-time AD technique to introduce resilience in critical
   infrastructures.}},

Abstract = {{SCADA traffic between the Human Machine Interface (HMI) and the
   Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is known to be highly periodic.
   However, it is sometimes multiplexed, due to asynchronous scheduling.
   Modeling the network traffic patterns of multiplexed SCADA streams using
   Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) for anomaly detection typically
   produces a very large DFA, and a high false-alarm rate. In this paper we
   introduce a new modeling approach that addresses this gap. Our
   Statechart DFA modeling includes multiple DFAs, one per cyclic pattern,
   together with a DFA-selector that de-multiplexes the incoming traffic
   into sub-channels and sends them to their respective DFAs. We evaluated
   our solution on traces from a production SCADA system using the Siemens
   S7-0x72 protocol. We also stress-tested our solution on a collection of
   synthetically-generated traces. In all but the most extreme scenarios
   the Statechart model drastically reduced both the false-alarm rate and
   the learned model size in comparison with the naive single-DFA model.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of networks within an organization made many critical
   infrastructures (CI) and their underlying communication networks that
   were rather isolated in the past, accessible from outside via internet.
   CI heavily rely on the security of their supervisory control and data
   acquisition (SCADA) systems. As attackers are using ever more
   sophisticated technologies the threats are always increasing. Therefore
   it is important to detect attacks quickly and react efficiently to them,
   thus increasing reliability, security and resilience of the system. To
   specify a model of security events, attacks and vulnerabilities, we
   propose an ontology. The system logs provide the events, which the
   intrusion detection systems (IDS) may recognize as suspicious and could
   be part of an attack. With the help of data bases for known
   vulnerabilities together with the system model ongoing attacks may be
   identified. The ontology-framework together with a respective reasoning
   component forms the common ground for compliance monitoring and
   correlation of security events and serves as a basis for the
   specification and implementation of security data normalization. Then
   security policies (or goals) can be refined into implementable
   configurations on critical infrastructure network devices.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic of Industrial Control System (ICS) between the Human Machine
   Interface (HMI) and the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is highly
   periodic. However, it is sometimes multiplexed, due to multi-threaded
   scheduling.
   In previous work we introduced a Statechart model which includes
   multiple Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA), one per cyclic pattern. We
   demonstrated that Statechart-based anomaly detection is highly effective
   on multiplexed cyclic traffic when the individual cyclic patterns are
   known. The challenge is to construct the Statechart, by unsupervised
   learning, from a captured trace of the multiplexed traffic, especially
   when the same symbols (ICS messages) can appear in multiple cycles, or
   multiple times in a cycle. Previously we suggested a combinatorial
   approach for the Statechart construction, based on Euler cycles in the
   Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC) graph of the trace. This combinatorial
   approach worked well in simple scenarios, but produced a false-alarm
   rate that was excessive on more complex multiplexed traffic.
   In this paper we suggest a new Statechart construction method, based on
   spectral analysis. We use the Fourier transform to identify the dominant
   periods in the trace. Our algorithm then associates a set of symbols
   with each dominant period, identifies the order of the symbols within
   each period, and creates the cyclic DFAs and the Statechart.
   We evaluated our solution on long traces from two production ICS: one
   using the Siemens S7-0x72 protocol and the other using Modbus. We also
   stress-tested our algorithms on a collection of synthetically-generated
   traces that simulate multiplexed ICS traces with varying levels of
   symbol uniqueness and time overlap. The resulting Statecharts model the
   traces with an overall median false-alarm rate as low as 0.16\% on the
   synthetic datasets, and with zero false-alarms on production S7-0x72
   traffic. Moreover, the spectral analysis Statecharts consistently
   out-performed the previous combinatorial Statecharts, exhibiting
   significantly lower false alarm rates and more compact model sizes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a novel domain-aware anomaly detection system that
   detects irregular changes in Modbus/TCP SCADA control register values.
   The research discovered the presence of three classes of registers: (i)
   sensor registers; (ii) counter registers; and (iii) constant registers.
   An automatic classifier was developed to identify these classes.
   Additionally, parameterized behavior models were created for each class.
   During its learning phase, the anomaly detection system used the
   classifier to identify the different types of registers and instantiated
   the model for each register based on its type. During the enforcement
   phase, the system detected deviations from the model. The anomaly
   detection system was evaluated using 131 h of traffic from a production
   SCADA system. The classifier had a true positive classification rate of
   93\%. During the enforcement phase, a 0.86\% false alarm rate was
   obtained for the correctly-classified registers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The adoption of open and widely used standards led to an increase in the
   grade of exposure and vulnerability in Supervisory Control and Data
   Acquisition (SCADA) systems. Therefore, the development of novel Anomaly
   Detection Systems (ADSs) specifically for SCADA systems is receiving a
   considerable attention from the scientific community. This paper goes
   beyond existing proposals and provides not only a novel ADS, but also a
   novel methodology for automatically configuring Snort-based ADSs
   deployed in SCADA systems. The methodology includes a graphical
   interface, a formal language, and shell scripts, used to model SCADA
   topologies and to automatically generate ADS rules. The approach is
   validated through several experiments and shows good performance with
   large topologies involving 100 LANs, 1000 hosts and 100 ADSs. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the problem of detection and isolation of
   attacks on a water distribution network comprised of cascaded canal
   pools. The proposed approach employs a bank of delay-differential
   observer systems. The observers are based on an analytically approximate
   model of canal hydrodynamics. Each observer is insensitive to one
   fault/attack mode and sensitive to other modes. The design of the
   observers is achieved by using a delay-dependent linear matrix
   inequality method. The performance of our model-based diagnostic scheme
   is tested on a class of adversarial scenarios based on a generalized
   fault/attack model. This model represents both classical sensor-actuator
   faults and communication network-induced deception attacks. Our
   particular focus is on stealthy deception attacks in which the
   attacker's goal is to pilfer water through canal offtakes. Our analysis
   reveals the benefits of accurate hydrodynamic models in detecting
   physical faults and cyber attacks to automated canal systems. We also
   comment on the criticality of sensor measurements for the purpose of
   detection. Finally, we discuss the knowledge and effort required for a
   successful deception attack.}},

Abstract = {{In the current national critical infrastructures, SCADA systems and
   networks are playing very important roles. Unfortunately, most of
   closed-network SCADA systems have been considered as very secure against
   cyber-attacks. Because they use their own operating systems and
   communication/network protocols, and their private networks are
   physically isolated from the public networks and the Internet. However,
   in case the closed SCADA system has m-connected status due to its
   maintenance, updates, and patches, it is no longer perfectly secure
   against cyber-attacks. This paper analyzes vulnerabilities of
   m-connected SCADA networks and proposes a novel security model for
   detecting network anomalies. The proposed model is based on an intrusion
   detection system using the network-based pattern reference method, which
   has two kinds of rule sets - one is the base rule set, and the other is
   dynamically produced rule set. The basic rule set can be set with
   pre-known intrusion patterns, and a dynamically produced new rule set
   can be set by detecting network anomalies under specific threshold
   values. Such new rule set would be adapted to the pattern reference
   model in its next execution time. Therefore, the proposed security model
   can identify abnormal command execution more effectively and
   efficiently.}},

Abstract = {{ICS (Industrial Control System) is a computer-controlled system that
   monitors and controls distributed field devices for power grid, water
   treatment and other industrial areas. Because ICS components fulfill
   their own roles, the network traffic of ICS has obvious regular
   patterns. These patterns can be used effectively in monitoring ICS
   network and detecting signs of cyber-attacks. In our previous work, we
   proposed a burst-based anomaly detection method for DNP3 protocol using
   the regularity of ICS network traffic. Traffic monitoring method such as
   switch mirroring causes many problems; packet duplication, packet
   out-of-order, and packet loss. The problems cause many false alarms.
   Furthermore, it is hard to decide whether the alarms caused by lost
   packets are true or false. In this paper, we apply our burst-based
   approach to TCP protocol in SCADA network and propose a method to manage
   monitoring problems for burst-based anomaly detection.}},

Abstract = {{Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are a core part
   of industrial systems, such as smart grid power and water distribution
   systems. In recent years, such systems become highly vulnerable to cyber
   attacks. The design of efficient and accurate data-driven anomaly
   detection models become an important topic of interest relating to the
   development of SCADA-specific Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) to
   counter cyber attacks. This paper proposes two novel techniques: (i) an
   automatic identification of consistent and inconsistent states of SCADA
   data for any given system, and (ii) an automatic extraction of proximity
   detection rules from identified states. During the identification phase,
   the density factor for the k-nearest neighbours of an observation is
   adapted to compute its inconsistency score. Then, an optimal
   inconsistency threshold is calculated to separate inconsistent from
   consistent observations. During the extraction phase, the well-known
   fixed-width clustering technique is extended to extract
   proximity-detection rules, which forms a small and most-representative
   data set for both inconsistent and consistent behaviours in the training
   data set. Extensive experiments were carried out both on real as well as
   simulated data sets, and we show that the proposed techniques provide
   significant accuracy and efficiency in detecting cyber attacks, compared
   to three well-known anomaly detection approaches. Crown Copyright (C)

abstract={In view of the problem that the intrusion detection method based on One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) could not detect the outliers within the industrial data, which results in the decision function deviating from the training sample, an anomaly intrusion detection algorithm based on Robust Incremental Principal Component Analysis (RIPCA) -OCSVM is proposed in this paper. The method uses RIPCA algorithm to remove outliers in industrial data sets and realize dimensionality reduction. In combination with the advantages of OCSVM on the single classification problem, an anomaly detection model is established, and the Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) is used for model parameter optimization. The simulation results show that the method can efficiently and accurately identify attacks or abnormal behaviors while meeting the real-time requirements of the industrial control system (ICS).},

pages={3630-3635},
abstract={In this paper, a velocity adaptive shuffled frog leaping bat algorithm (VASFLBA) is proposed to solve the problem that the bat algorithm (BA) is easy to fall into local optimum and a lack of deep local search ability. Firstly, the influence of the current stochastic local optimal solution on the search of the algorithm is considered. Two adaptive proportional regulation factors are introduced to balance global and local search. Then, the locally deep search ability is enhanced by using the meme transfer mechanism of shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA). In addition, stochastic population competition is introduced to improve the global search ability and when the algorithm trapped in the local optimum, differential mutation operation is performed on the current global optimal bat so that the algorithm can jump out of the local optimum. The superiority of VASFLBA is verified by benchmark test functions. On this basis, VASFLBA is used to optimize the parameters of support vector machine (SVM) in intrusion detection of industrial control system (ICS), and the standard dataset for ICS intrusion detection is used for simulation. The results show that, compared with BA, SFLA and other algorithms, VASFLBA can better solve the problem of SVM parameters selection.},

abstract={World is talking about connecting everything to the internet. Electric grids are no exception, and are rather one of the first application areas of the proposal. This connection with the internet has raised concerns about the inherent supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, whose structure too is adapting with the upcoming needs. The security concerns also include other vulnerabilities, which are not caused due to the internet connectivity, but rather due to some disgruntled employee or social engineering. The paper incorporates the intrusion detection systems (IDSs) created worldwide and proposes an integrated triple layer module. This includes a novel “What-if” module based layer to predict the malicious intent of a command signal. This module is also expected to predict some impending failure of the system. The other two layers include one communication protection layer and one data authentication layer for field devices. We eventually clarify why all the IDS being proposed worldwide shall benefit if these work in tandem amongst themselves and moreover in tandem with the proposed “What-if” module.},

The security of SCADA systems represents a significant subject on account of the critical function that these systems perform in offering vital utility services. In nowadays industrial systems ubiquitous access to Internet enhance the vulnerabilities of SCADA systems, for the reason that this allows a remote attacker to obtain control of, or produce interruption to the network critical functions. The attacks affect the network control plane and /or the data plane. Critical infrastructures, requiring uninterrupted operation, maintenance, and protection, have need of robust and secured control SCADA systems.

SCADA process control systems are typically isolated from the internet via firewalls. However, they may still be subject to illicit cyber penetrations and may be subject to cyber threats from disgruntled insiders. We have developed a set of command injection, data injection, and denial of service attacks which leverage the lack of authentication in many common control system communication protocols including MODBUS, DNP3, and EtherNET/IP. We used these exploits to aid in development of a neural network based intrusion detection system which monitors control system physical behavior to detect artifacts of command and response injection attacks. Finally, we present intrusion detection accuracy results for our neural network based IDS which includes input features derived from physical properties of the control system.},

abstract={Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are more vulnerable to cyber and physical attacks than the conventional systems because of the tight integration of the cyber, communication and control aspects of CPS. Deceptive attacks are very severe on such systems because they go undetected when classical detectors like chi-squared detector is used. Once such deceptive attack that we focus in this paper are false data injection attacks, where the attacker inputs carefully designed false attack vectors. Chi-square detector which detects based on the statistics of deviations of the residual i.e. difference of observed measurement and estimated measurement fails to detect these attacks, since the statistics is not changed in these attacks. “Cosine similarity detector” was proposed to detect False Data Injection (FDI) attacks in smart grid scenario. However, we show that there exists attack vectors that remain stealthy to both chi-square as well as the cosine-square detectors. We propose an random coding scheme to modify the measurements at random, unknown to the attacker while known to the estimator. We establish that our coding scheme in conjunction with the cosine similarity detector provides promising detection performance.},

abstract={We consider the problem of securing a given control loop implementation of a cyber-physical system (CPS) in the presence of Man-in-the-Middle attacks on data exchange between plant and controller over a compromised network. To this end, there exists various detection schemes which provide mathemat¬ical guarantees against such attacks for the theoretical control model. However, such guarantees may not hold for the actual control software implementation. In this article, we propose a formal approach towards synthesizing attack detectors with varying thresholds which can prevent performance degrading stealthy attacks while minimizing false alarms.},

abstract={In this research, we proposed a process-based anomaly detection method for Cyber-Physical System (CPS). Our method performs relaxation on monitoring the data and focuses more on the relationship of the execution order of message passing between the devices in the MQTT-based network. First, we performed a `bird's eye' monitoring technique to discover the execution order of message passing in the MQTT network with process mining. Then, we grasp the structure of the process model with a tree model called a process tree. Using the process tree, we check the deviations of normal behavior's process tree and the monitored behavior's process tree. Since CPS is a closed-loop system and MQTT protocol has pre-specified execution, we can easily detect deviations in the process tree as an anomaly. However, it is still hard to perform forensic analysis. Next, we proposed a forensic analysis method, which comes as an advantage of this approach compared to the black-boxed detection method, such as machine learning. The process-based approach can backtrack message passing by traversing the process tree and identify the execution operator in the parent nodes to find affected devices and execution order related to the incident. Finally, we showed an application example and evaluation of our method.},

abstract={Detecting process-based attacks on industrial control systems (ICS) is challenging. These cyber-attacks are designed to disrupt the industrial process by changing the state of a system, while keeping the system's behaviour close to the expected behaviour. Such anomalous behaviour can be effectively detected by an event-driven approach. Petri Net (PN) model identification has proved to be an effective method for event-driven system analysis and anomaly detection. However, PN identification-based anomaly detection methods require ICS device logs to be converted into event logs (sequence of events). Therefore, in this paper we present a formalised method for pre-processing and transforming ICS device logs into event logs. The proposed approach outperforms the previous methods of device logs processing in terms of anomaly detection. We have demonstrated the results using two published datasets.},

abstract={The integration of communication networks and the Internet of Things (IoT) in Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) increases their vulnerability towards cyber-attacks, causing devastating outcomes. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), which are mainly developed to support information technology systems, count vastly on predefined models and are trained mostly on specific cyber-attacks. Besides, most IDSs do not consider the imbalanced nature of ICS datasets, thereby suffering from low accuracy and high false-positive when being put to use. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model to construct new balanced representations of the imbalanced datasets. The new representations are fed into an ensemble deep learning attack detection model specifically designed for an ICS environment. The proposed attack detection model leverages Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Decision Tree (DT) classifiers to detect cyber-attacks from the new representations. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated based on 10-fold cross-validation on two real ICS datasets. The results show that the proposed method outperforms conventional classifiers, including Random Forest (RF), DNN, and AdaBoost, as well as recent existing models in the literature. The proposed approach is a generalized technique, which can be implemented in existing ICS infrastructures with minimum effort.},

abstract={The algorithm of causal anomaly detection in industrial control physics is proposed to determine the normal cloud line of industrial control system so as to accurately detect the anomaly. In this paper, The causal modeling algorithm combining Maximum Information Coefficient and Transfer Entropy was used to construct the causal network among nodes in the system. Then, the abnormal nodes and the propagation path of the anomaly are deduced from the structural changes of the causal network before and after the attack. Finally, an anomaly detection algorithm based on hybrid differential cumulative is used to identify the specific anomaly data in the anomaly node. The stability of causality mining algorithm and the validity of locating causality anomalies are verified by using the data of classical chemical process. Experimental results show that the anomaly detection algorithm is better than the comparison algorithm in accuracy, false negative rate and recall rate, and the anomaly location strategy makes the anomaly source traceable.},

abstract={GPS receiver is the source of synchronization in phasor measurement unit (PMU) networks. While it guarantees time precision, it is vulnerable to cyberattacks, which may modify the time offset and results in mismatches in time. This modification (GPS spoofing attack) changes the phase angle of signals measured by PMU. This article deals with three important challenges in GPS spoofing attack detection; first, multiattack detection while there are probable attacks on different PMUs, second, attack detection considering the dynamic model of power systems, and third, measurement correction. For providing solution to the abovementioned problems, an anti-GPS spoofing attack mechanism is suggested, in which, a dynamic filter with the help of PMU and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems measurements estimate the phase shifts caused by spoofing attacks. The results of data fusion of PMUs and SCADA in the detection method are shown. Numerical results demonstrate that this approach can detect dynamic spoofing attacks in a reasonable time and as soon as multiple attacks are detected, corrected measurements are provided.},

abstract = "Industrial Cyber-physical systems (ICPSs), integrating communication, computation and control of industrial processes are referred to as a core technology to approach the Industry 4.0. Ensuring the ICPS security is of paramount importance in smart manufacturing. Considering the characteristics of large-scale, geographically-dispersed and multi-dimensional heterogeneous, federated and life-critical natures of ICPSs, this paper investigates a hierarchically distributed intrusion detection scheme that seeks to achieve the all-round safety protection of ICPSs according to the system structure and attacking types of each ICPS layer. For physical system-relevant perceptual executive layer, potential and covert attacks are detected by the clustered sensory system state residual anomaly monitoring based on a process noise and measurement noise-adaptive Kalman filter (PNMN-AKF). PNMN-AKF can perform a joint recursive estimation of dynamic system states, time-varying process and measurement noise covariance matrices by the variational Bayes approximation framework. In cyberspace, potential cyber-attacks are detected by the anomaly monitoring of the statistical distribution of the network transmission characteristics of data transmission layer by introducing a forgetting factor-induced recursive Gaussian mixture model (FF-RGMM). In the application control layer, a regularized sparse deep belief network model is introduced to characterize the misuse behavior for detecting potential attacks. Extensive validation and comparative experiments have been conducted on a numerical simulation system and a comprehensive ICPS simulation platform by using OPNET and a commonly-used benchmark simplified Tennessee Eastman process (STEP) based on Matlab/Simulink. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hierarchically distributed intrusion detection method can efficiently recognize potential and covert cyber-attacks in each ICPSs link with low false alarm rate and missing detection rate, which lays a foundation for the overall security monitoring of ICPSs."

Detection and prevention of anomalous behaviors such as cyber attacks are of vital importance. This paper focuses on a method to detect such anomalous behaviors in near real-time using laptop class processing power. ICSs depend on the sensor measurements to monitor and operate a plant. Moreover, any change in the behaviors of a physical process due to an attack can also be unearthed from the sensor measurements. Under different circumstances, these sensor measurements follow typical patterns. A partially defined Boolean function based supervised classification method, known as Logical Analysis of Data (LAD), can extract patterns (or rules) from historical sensor measurements, and these rules can categorize the condition of a plant. In this paper, these rules are used to design an Anomaly Detection System (ADS) to unearth anomalous behaviors. The efficacy of the proposed method is assessed using the sensor measurements from a testbed known as Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) system. The proposed technique is generic and can be extended to other ICSs such as power and transportation. Additionally, compared to other anomaly detection approaches, LAD-based ADS also helps to localize the anomaly."

This paper investigates the attack signal estimation for intrusion detection of actuator false data injection attacks. Taking advantage of extended state observer, the attack signal is described as system disturbance and can be estimated. We propose two attack signal estimators, i.e., linear attack signal estimator (LASE) and nonlinear attack signal estimator (NASE). Through the analysis in the frequency domain, the influence of the attack signal frequency on the estimation performance of LASE is obtained. Both simulation and experimental results illustrate that the proposed estimators can achieve good performance."

In the recent years, some works have focused on using physical metrics in addition to the popular network-based and host-based intrusion detection approaches. This paper presents a taxonomy that considers the special features of cyberphysical intrusion detection systems (IDSs) with examples from the literature.

abstract={Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems monitor and supervise our daily infrastructure systems and industrial processes. Hence, the security of the information systems of critical infrastructures cannot be overstated. The effectiveness of unsupervised anomaly detection approaches is sensitive to parameter choices, especially when the boundaries between normal and abnormal behaviours are not clearly distinguishable. Therefore, the current approach in detecting anomaly for SCADA is based on the assumptions by which anomalies are defined; these assumptions are controlled by a parameter choice. This paper proposes an add-on anomaly threshold technique to identify the observations whose anomaly scores are extreme and significantly deviate from others, and then such observations are assumed to be ”abnormal”. The observations whose anomaly scores are significantly distant from ”abnormal” ones will be assumed as ”normal”. Then, the ensemble-based supervised learning is proposed to find a global and efficient anomaly threshold using the information of both ”normal”/”abnormal” behaviours. The proposed technique can be used for any unsupervised anomaly detection approach to mitigate the sensitivity of such parameters and improve the performance of the SCADA unsupervised anomaly detection approaches. Experimental results confirm that the proposed technique achieved a significant improvement compared to the state-of-the-art of two unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms. © 2020 by the authors.

On the other hand, SCADA systems are highly exposed to new vulnerabilities as it highly relies on the internet. Machine learning approaches have been employed to detect the cyberattacks injected by the attackers in CIs. However, those approaches failed to protect the CIs against the ever-advancing nature of cyberattacks.

abstract={Layered inter-network communications, and dynamic control mechanisms of intra-connected testbeds in cyber-physical systems (CPS) paves way for controlling the PLCs and HMIs in a distributive manner. This intuits the idea of monitoring and logging the CPS traffic by embedding the motorized sensor/actuator readings into an IP-network packet. Attackers commence the network packet intervention of a CPS traffic as an initial phase for launching cyber-based attacks over critical public infrastructures. Log sequences captured for such an instance, required the security professional to observe the log sub-sequences that might possibly lead to an attack, unlisted in the signature repository of the existing defense mechanisms. Hence, this paper defines a hypergraph based attack detection model where constraints can be parameterized based on the type of CPS traffic in order to provide adaptable degree of representing possible attack incidents for the existing intrusion detection systems. Post defining the model’s parameterized constraints; we study the attack scenarios over Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) dataset from SUTD’s iTrust lab. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Given the importance of an early anomaly detection, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are introduced in Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA). Agents or probes form the cornerstone of any IDS by capturing network packets and extracting relevant information. However, IDSs are facing unprecedented challenges due to the escalation in the number, scale and diversity of attacks. Software-Defined Network (SDN) then comes into play and can provide the required flexibility and scalability. Building on that, we introduce Traffic Agent Controllers (TACs) that monitor SDN-enabled switches via Open-Flow. By using lightweight statistical metrics such as Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD), we are able to detect the slightest anomalies, such as stealth port scans, even in the presence of background traffic. The obtained metrics can also be used to locate the anomalies with precision over 90% inside a hierarchical network topology. © 2019 IEEE.},

Due to the use of request-response communication in polling, SCADA traffic exhibits stable and predictable communication patterns. This paper provides a timing-based anomaly detection system that uses the statistical attributes of the communication patterns. This system is validated with three datasets, one generated from real devices and two from emulated networks, and is shown to have a False Positive Rate (FPR) under 1.4%. The tests are performed in the context of three different attack scenarios, which involve valid messages so they cannot be detected by whitelisting mechanisms. The detection accuracy and timing performance are adequate for all the attack scenarios in request-response communications. With other interaction patterns (i.e. spontaneous communications), we found instead that 2 out of 3 attacks are detected. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

abstract={With the arrival of Industry 4.0, more and more industrial control systems are connected with the outside world, which brings tremendous convenience to industrial production and control, and also introduces many potential security hazards. After a large number of attack cases analysis, we found that attacks in SCADA systems can be divided into internal attacks and external attacks. Both types of attacks are inevitable. Traditional firewalls, IDSs and IPSs are no longer suitable for industrial control systems. Therefore, we propose behavior-based anomaly detection and build three baselines of normal behaviors. Experiments show that using our proposed detection model, we can quickly detect a variety of attacks on SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) systems. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.},

abstract={In Industrial Control Systems (ICS/SCADA), machine to machine data traffic is highly periodic. Past work showed that in many cases, it is possible to model the traffic between each individual Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) and the SCADA server by a cyclic Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), and to use the model to detect anomalies in the traffic. However, a recent analysis of network traffic in a water facility in the U.S, showed that cyclic-DFA models have limitations. In our research, we examine the same data corpus; our study shows that the communication on all of the channels in the network is done in bursts of packets, and that the bursts have semantic meaning-the order within a burst depends on the messages. Using these observations, we suggest a new burst- DFA model that .ts the data much be.er than previous work. Our model treats the traffic on each channel as a series of bursts, and matches each burst to the DFA, taking the burst's beginning and end into account. Our burst-DFA model successfully explains between 95% and 99% of the packets in the data-corpus, and goes a long way toward the construction of a practical anomaly detection system. © 2017 ACM.},

First of all, the supervised learning methods, such as Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, SVM and so on, were adopted to deal with SCADA network dataset and related discriminated features. Next, an anomaly detection model is built using One-Class classification method, and the effect of the One-Class Classification method in the SCADA network dataset is analyzed from the recall rate, the accuracy rate, the false positive rate and the false negative rate. It is shown that the anomaly detection model constructed by the One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) method has high accuracy, and the Decision Tree method can commendably detect the intrusion behavior. © 2018, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

As an example we have shown an application of the technique to the IEC-60870-5-104 protocol and tested the anomaly detector with mixed results. The detection accuracy and false positive rate, as well as real-time response was adequate for 3 of our 4 created attacks.

abstract={This paper presents the initial findings in applying a behavior-based approach for detection of unauthorized activities in a simulated Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. Misuse detection of this type utilizes fault-free system telemetry to develop empirical models that learn normal system behavior. Future monitored telemetry sources that show statistically significant deviations from this learned behavior may indicate an attack or other unwanted actions. The experimental test bed consists of a set of Linux based enterprise servers that were isolated from a larger university research cluster. All servers are connected to a private network and simulate several components and tasks seen in a typical SCADA system. Telemetry sources included kernel statistics, resource usages and internal system hardware measurements. For this study, the Auto Associative Kernel Regression (AAKR) and Auto Associative Multivariate State Estimation Technique (AAMSET) are employed to develop empirical models. Prognostic efficacy of these methods for computer security used several groups of signals taken from available telemetry classes. The Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) is used along with these models for intrusion detection purposes. The different intrusion types shown include host/network discovery, DoS, brute force login, privilege escalation and malicious exfiltration actions. For this study, all intrusion types tested displayed alterations in the residuals of much of the monitored telemetry and were able to be detected in all signal groups used by both model types. The methods presented can be extended and implemented to industries besides nuclear that use SCADA or business-critical networks. Copyright © (2017) by American Nuclear Society.

abstract={When SCADA systems are exposed to public networks, attackers can more easily penetrate the control systems that operate electrical power grids, water plants, and other critical infrastructures. To detect such attacks, SCADA systems require an intrusion detection technique that can understand the information carried by their usually proprietary network protocols. To achieve that goal, we propose to attach to SCADA systems a specification-based intrusion detection framework based on Bro [7][8], a runtime network traffic analyzer. We have built a parser in Bro to support DNP3, a network protocol widely used in SCADA systems that operate electrical power grids. This built-in parser provides a clear view of all network events related to SCADA systems. Consequently, security policies to analyze SCADA-specific semantics related to the network events can be accurately defined. As a proof of concept, we specify a protocol validation policy to verify that the semantics of the data extracted from network packets conform to protocol definitions. We performed an experimental evaluation to study the processing capabilities of the proposed intrusion detection framework. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

abstract={SCADA security is an increasingly important research area as these systems, used for process control and automation, are being exposed to the Internet due to their use of TCP/IP protocols as a transport mechanism for control messages. Most of the existing research work on SCADA systems has focused on addressing SCADA security by monitoring at- tacks or anomalies at the network level. The main issue affecting these systems today is that by focusing our attention on network-level monitoring needs, security practitioners may remain unaware of process level constraints. The proposed framework helps ensure that a mechanism is in place to help map process level constraints, as described by process engineers, to network level monitoring needs. Existing solutions have tried to address this problem but have not been able to fully bridge the gap between the process and the network. The goal of this research is to provide a solution that (i) leverages the knowledge process engineers have about the system (to help strengthen cyber security) and that has the ability to (ii) seamlessly monitors process constraints at the network level using standard network security tools. A prototype system for theModbus TCP protocol and the Bro IDS has been built to validate the approach. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems represent a vulnerability in vital infrastructures. For example, an electric power system is subjected to intrusions via its SCADA systems; however, the instrumentation provides detectable variations in response to such interference. Presented herein is a strategy that augments state estimation methods using a Hybrid Fuzzy System for fault monitoring and diagnosis that aims to combine information from multiple domains in order to detect, isolate, identify, and mitigate threats to the system. Furthermore, to endow the state estimation solution methods with some degree of numerical robustness, algorithm-based error detection (ABED) is applied to the Gaussian elimination procedure. Simulation results revealed that ABED provides error detection at low costs and excellent error coverage for floating point arithmetic in the presence of permanent bit and word errors while being free of false alarms and insensitive to both data range and data size.

abstract={Most critical infrastructure such as chemical processing plants, electrical generation and distribution networks, and gas distribution is monitored and controlled by Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition Systems (SCADA. These systems have been the focus of increased security and there are concerns that they could be the target of international terrorists. With the constantly growing number of internet related computer attacks, there is evidence that our critical infrastructure may also be vulnerable. Researchers estimate that malicious online actions may cause $75 billion at 2007. One of the interesting countermeasures for enhancing information system security is called intrusion detection. This paper will briefly discuss the history of research in intrusion detection techniques and introduce the two basic detection approaches: signature detection and anomaly detection. Finally, it presents the application of techniques developed for monitoring critical process systems, such as nuclear power plants, to anomaly intrusion detection. The method uses an autoassociative kernel regression (AAKR) model coupled with the statistical probability ratio test (SPRT) and applied to a simulated SCADA system. The results show that these methods can be generally used to detect a variety of common attacks.},

abstract={Due to the rapid increase in digitalization and networking of systems, especially in industrial environments, the number of cyber-physical systems is increasing and thus the danger of possible attacks on such systems. As demonstrated in several recent examples, a cyber attack on an industrial control system (ICS) can have catastrophic consequences for humans and machines. This is due to the communication networks between programmable logic controllers (PLC), actuators and sensors, which are usually vulnerable to attacks, as well as various processes or devices that are not sufficiently protected. In this paper, two possible attacks on a discrete event system (DES) are introduced, in which a running process, controlled by a PLC, is manipulated without being detected. Furthermore, a detection method for such attacks is presented. © 2019 EUCA.},

abstract={In this paper we present an unconventional anti ICS-malware approach. We leverage a factor that appears to be overlooked as of this writing, namely that ICS malware often infect machines which do not run any functions related to industrial process control. These may be, for example, business machines in the enterprise networks of power utility companies, or even random machines on the Internet. Because ICS environments use special-purpose communication protocols, it is highly unlikely that any application code on those machines will send or receive network traffic through an ICS communication protocol. On the other hand, ICS malware discover their targets via searches that initiate ICS communication protocol traffic. Our approach uses a kernel filter driver to analyze the network traffic that flows through a real NIC. The kernel filter driver works with a module that uses in-kernel ICS protocol signatures to recognize ICS protocol traffic embedded within the network traffic in question. Our approach can detect 0-day malware on machines that are unrelated to industrial process control, without any prior knowledge of their internal code and data. We performed extensive testing against malware samples involved in recent cyber attack campaigns, as well as safety and efficiency tests, and thus discuss the findings in the paper. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Network security monitoring using machine learning algorithms is a topic that has been well researched and found to be difficult to use. We propose to use a specific approach in restricted IP network environments and leverage the net-work state information and information from individual connections for increased level of sensitivity. The approach is meant for use in restricted IP networks which exhibit a level of determinism that enables the use of machine learning approach. In this work we use algorithm called Self-Organizing Maps. We introduce an implementation of self-organizing maps engine built on top of the Bro network security monitor. An implemented selection of initial features for the Self-Organizing Maps is provided and a sample sub-set is used when training a SOM lattice for network data from an industrial control system environment. The anomaly detection prototype described in this paper is meant as a complementary mechanism, not a standalone solution for network security monitoring. Copyright is held by the flowner/author(s).},

abstract={Security in CPS-based real-time embedded systems controlling the power grid has been an afterthought, but it is becoming a critical issue as CPS systems are networked and inter-dependent. This work presents a set of mechanisms for timebased intrusion detection, i.e., the execution of unauthorized instructions in realtime CPS environments. The novelty is the utilization of information obtained by static timing analysis for intrusion detection. Real-time CPS systems are unique in that timing bounds on code sections are readily available since they are required for schedulability analysis.We demonstrate how micro-timings can be exploited for multiple granularity levels of application code to track execution progress. Through bounds checking of these micro-timings, we develop techniques to detect intrusions (1) in a self-checking manner by the application and (2) through the operating system scheduler, which are novel contributions to the real-time/embedded systems domain to the best of our knowledge. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.},
